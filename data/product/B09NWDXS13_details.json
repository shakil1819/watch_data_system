                "description": "Delivering a new evolution in fitness tracking, health management, and mobile communication, Apple has upgraded key aspects of the Watch Series 7 to benefit everyone in your family. The Watch Series 7 is more user friendly, with an always-on OLED Retina display that provides approximately 20% more screen area than the Series 6, and 50% more than the Series 3. Apple achieved this by making the borders roughly 40% thinner than the Series 6, so you get more screen without adding bulk. The display is also stronger and brighter, up to 70% brighter in fact, which makes it even easier to read notifications or check the time at a glance. The front crystal is crack resistant and sports IP6X and WR50 ratings for significant dust resistance and swimproof water resistance down to 164'. So you can work out in the gym, swim in the pool or open water, or bike off road without worry. The 41mm body of this particular version of the Watch Series 7 adds to its overall resilience as it's constructed from strong 100% recycled aluminum material. This improved durability works well with the Series 7's ability to track 11 different workout types, with Tai Chi and Pilates now added to the mix. The Watch Series 7 is also now better optimized for bike riders, automatically detecting when you start pedaling and if you take a break. It even knows if you fall and can ring for help if needed. Add in multiple health sensors, sleep tracking, up to 18 hours of fast-charging battery life, and the Apple Watch Series 7 can easily be a 24/7 companion that can help you in nearly all aspects of your daily life.",
