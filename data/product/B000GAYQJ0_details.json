                "top_review": "Ha. This is a watch of contradictions. Cheap, yet well-made. Small, but noticeable. Old, but it feels so damn new. The watch performs flawlessly and despite mentions of it being retro, it is slick, modern, and even better looking in person.I will say, however, that I found the included contract unusual and potentially disturbing. When I placed the order, a prompt I\u2019d never seen before appeared, inviting me to read and sign a contract. The document stated rather explicitly that the watch was for \u201chandsome guys\u201d and that I would not be permitted to wear it if I was a \u201cmajor uggo\u201d. Whatever. I signed the contract and placed the order. What happened next was the truly unexpected...Two days after placing the order, I received a knock on my door very late at night. I wish I could tell you what time it was, but I did not yet own the watch so it is impossible to say. I peered through my peephole and saw the figure of a tall man in a long coat. Slowly, I opened the door and asked him what he wanted. It\u2019s then I noticed a wristwatch with the largest band I\u2019d ever seen wrapped around his forehead. It was analog, so I couldn\u2019t tell the time. The man introduced himself in a voice so quiet his words were almost drowned out by the ticking of his pretentious headwatch. \u201cI\u2019m with Casio,\u201d he says. Or maybe \u201cDime sith mass E oh\u201d. Hard to say. Still confused, I asked him again what he wanted. It was then that things took a turn for the worse.Uninvited, he stepped into my home and grabbed my face with his cold, dry, watch-tuning fingers. I tried to resist and found my body unresponsive. I\u2019ve later theorized that his stupid, unreadable headwatch was in some way hypnotic and temporarily robbed me of my senses. By the dim porch light, he jerked my head around, carefully but methodically inspecting every angle of my face. It obviously wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d conducted this sick facial analysis.Suddenly, he stopped. With me still immobile and deathly frightened, he took a step back, gave me one final, fleeting check and muttered \u201cAcceptable. Seven out of ten.\u201d Having said this, he promptly tapped the dial on his gaudy headwatch and I fell to the ground, exhausted and overwhelmed by my experience, but released from his spell.The next thing I knew, it was morning and someone was calling for me. \u201cSir? Sir? Are you okay?\u201d I looked up and saw my door was agape and the mail person stood above me, package in hand. Embarrassed to have been defeated by the mysterious man and his unfashionable watch, I simply nodded and began to stand. Obviously unsettled, the mail person handed me the package as I rose and told me to have a good day. It was my watch! And boy, what a watch it is!The moral of the story is this: the watch is incredible, and at $20 perhaps the finest entry-level watch money can buy.However, potential buyer, I caution you this: if you are any less than a 6.5 or 7 out of 10, don\u2019t kid yourself. Perhaps you\u2019ve got more a F91W or G-Shock type of face, and that\u2019s nothing to feel bad about. Not everyone can be handsome! Just be careful - I\u2019ve heard the watchman and his hideous headwatch do not look kindly upon the unattractive.\n  \nRead more",

                "description": "Necessity is not the mother of invention, invention is the mother of necessity.\" These are the words of one of Casio's founders. The people who created Casio were determined to 'invent necessity'- to create products that met latent needs with groundbreaking capabilities no one had ever seen before.

Bringing you a sure fit, this charming timepiece is soon to become your every-day favorite. P.when('A').execute(function(A) { A.on('a:expander:toggle_description:toggle:collapse', function(data) { window.scroll(0, data.expander.$expander[0].offsetTop-100); }); }); Casio With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market. Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward. See more",
