This time I would have, and this was the watch I planned to buy, but they didn't have it in blue, so I abstained on the ship, and ordered this one the day I got home.So why this one?  A couple of reasons.1.) It just has that classic diver look to it.2.) A friend of mine has this watch, and EVERY time I see it when we hang out, it catches my eye.  He abuses his, and years later it still looks great, which is a testament to its durability.3.) Feature packed.Ok - so let's talk about the features.1.) Eco Drive - this is a time-tested technology, and I have several Citizen Eco Drive watches, to include a 1st Gen Eco Drive purchased in 1996 that STILL takes a charge and runs when I get it out.2.) Mineral glass window - not the scratch resistance of sapphire, but TOUGH.3.) Accurate movement.  Prior to DST, I set the watch about 3 weeks prior and it had gained a grand total of 2 seconds.  That's about +3 seconds a month.  You can't find an automatic that will do that.4.) Water resistance to 200 meters with a screw-down crown.5.) Hacking movement - when you pull the stem to the 2nd click, the second hand stops, and that allows you to sync it to the exact second to another time source.-- Side note on movement.  I considered getting the version of this watch with the automatic/self-winding movement, but the movement in that watch is the Miyota 8204, which is a 21.6k movement (rather than 28.8k) that only has an accuracy guarantee of +/- 20 seconds/day.  I have other automatics that are considerably more accurate than thatBottom line - this watch looks great, and it's built to last.  I know I'll get a lot of years of use out of this timepiece.I've included two pics of this watch.  One with the stock blue rubber diver's strap, and another with an aftermarket bracelet that is specifically fitted for this watch case.  I'd name it here but I think that would invalidate the review.  In any case, it's pretty easy to find if you prefer that aesthetic, and it isn't terribly expensive - the stainless bracelet is well worth the investment and it gives the option of either aesthetic.\n  \nRead more",
