This watch is exactly the same as what you would buy in store, but without the wait. I have always liked this Apple Watch because I've never needed the newest one. The functionality, sound quality, Watch quality, and weight were always some of my favorite things about it. I love that this one came with the more cream/rose colored band. But for work I usually just used my old band so I don\u2019t damage the new one. If you want an Apple Watch at a good price and don\u2019t need the newest one, I would suggest this one. I like the price of it a lot better too.\n  \nRead more",
