It has been a game changer for my exercise routine and essential for my overall health. And as someone with ADHD, this has been an amazing tool for locating my phone in a pinch.I have to take a lot of medication in a day. I put the information in the health app and set reminders, the watch reminds me until I long the medication. It\u2019s been very helpful, and provides an easy way to record the time my meds were taken. I consistently have panic attacks, and my watch will notify me when my heart rate spikes, giving me enough time to relocate and try to ground myself. The breathe app is also a great grounding tool for me, the haptic feedback is a great thing to focus on when everything else around me gets hard to process. Furthermore, it has made it easier to sleep! I have never completed a 5 min breathing exercise in bed, I always fall asleep before it is done. I just close my eyes and match my breathing with the vibrations, it eases the anxiety and gives my brain something to focus on when winding down. Speaking of the haptic feedback, that combined with the amazing sound coming from this watch has broken my habit of snoozing the alarm and falling back asleep. This watch also tracks my sleep, so I can get an idea of how long I sleep each night!For exercise, it has been nice tracking my steps. I had no idea that I walked up and down 27-30 flights of stairs at work! I knew I moved around a lot, but not that much. It serves as good motivation for recording my exercises at the gym. I now log everything and can create a nicer workout schedule.The battery life is great, and it takes maybe 45 mins to charge. I keep it on when I\u2019m sleeping and charge it when I\u2019m showering before work. It is water resistant, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be comfortable with wearing a watch in the shower. So far there have been no scratches on the display, and I don\u2019t have a screen protector on it. The only thing I don\u2019t like is the wristband. I think it induces sweat that ultimately irritates my skin, so I habitually wipe it down with an alcohol pad. I\u2019m on the lookout for a professional looking band that has nice airflow.\n  \nRead more",
