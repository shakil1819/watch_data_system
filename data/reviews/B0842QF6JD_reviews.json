                        "content": "I was looking for a sports watch that can also work great as a daily driver. Wouldn't even consider a G-Shocks, as I'm ex-military, and G-Shocks just remind me of the service. So... Ended up buying this little watch, and it really is much better than a G-Shock. Pros:1. The watch is 38 mm and fits perfectly on my 6.1\" wrist.2. Strap is comfortable.3. Legibility is great, large readable digits.4. Has 3 alarm clocks, each with a different tone.5. Lights keep working as long as you're pressing buttons. That means you can finish setting whatever you need, without needing to press for lights again. Lights turn off several seconds after last press.6. Buttons are large and comfortable.7. Helps me use my smartphone less, as I'm not reaching for it anymore to tell the time and set timers.8. Unused features can be completely turned off, so they don't clutter the interface.Cons-1. Alarm clock is pretty loud. But I'm a deep sleeper, and I don't completely trust it to wake me up. Maybe if I set all 3 alarms consecutively, it might wake me up.2. Rarely, the strap pinches my arm hair.3. The occasion mode is pretty useless now that we have smartphones (But can be completely turned off).Overall really impressed with this watch, all the features feel really well thought out. I would highly recommend buying.",

It's easy to read, using the buttons for run times is just a press of a button. Hit it again to get another lap or to stop it. The indigo light comes in handy at night to read the time. I'd also say it's very durable for the price. I literally beat watches up and this thing kept ticking for years and years. I only got a new once the watch band snapped.",

                        "content": "Before I start my review of this Timex....A few words about Casio, because there are millions of Casio fans, many of whom won\u2019t ever admit that any non-Casio product could ever be superior in any way to a Casio.Yes, Casio makes amazing watches (& other gadgets). I have owned several. Great company. Over the decades, the company has produced thousands of watches with remarkable features like address & appointment management, altimeter, barometer, games, moon & tide phases, GPS, compasses, atomic clock auto-setting, solar power, etc. Great products.But .... if you want one amazing sport watch, nothing beats this Timex model. It has features one simply does not find on any Casio or any other digital watch brand or model. It is the perfect balance of features and simplicity with durability and comfort.1) Major Comfort.This watch is amazingly comfortable for 5 reasons. It\u2019s lightweight. The band is soft silicon, not hard plastic. The band has a contour, which matches your wrist curve. The band has a lot of holes, so you can get a perfect fit. The little \u201cband keeper\u201d loop actually locks into the excess band, so the keeper won\u2019t slide around. Other sports watches have some combo of rigid plastic band, not enough holes, no locking band keeper.2) Customizable Features.What I mean by this is that you can \u201chide\u201d features from the Mode scroll-through if you aren\u2019t interested in one or more. Easy example: the watch has three alarms. I use just one. I don\u2019t plan to use the other two. I don\u2019t want to see the other two alarms as I go through the watch functions. So I set it so that I don\u2019t even see alarms 2 & 3 when I scroll through. This is a unique feature. Almost no digital watches have it. It\u2019s a great way to simplify your watch\u2019s configurations, if you like.3) Ease of Setting.This watch is really intuitive to set (& to set up as I described immediately above). This is because it has 5 buttons and the screen itself shows you with labels how to \u201c+\u201d or \u201c-\u201c the time when setting the time itself or an alarm. Amazingly straightforward. Absent on almost all other watches.4) The Features Themselves.Without discussing all aspects is this watch (stopwatch, countdown timer, water resistance, etc.), I\u2019ll focus on two unique features. (A) The alarm is loud. Unless you are medicinally sedated or are sleeping really heavily after a 48-hour nonstop work session, it *will* wake you up.(B) The Indiglo light (a technology Timex introduced almost 30 years ago) is amazing for reading the display at night or in a dark room (Related: The size of the display is great too. Bold, crisp, large (even though the watch face itself is not enormous)).If you are undecided, I\u2019d suggest reading this review and then watching a couple YouTube reviews. If you\u2019re still on the fence, just buy the watch. You\u2019ll love it. Can you get a durable & functional non-Timex for $20 or under? Yes. But go with this for the slightly higher price.",

                        "content": "I had this exact watch as a teenager back in the early 2000\u2019s, and I remember loving it. It was comfortable, easy to use, feature-packed, and able to take any of the (considerable) abuse a teenage boy could throw at it.Now I\u2019m in my early thirties and looking for a watch after a long hiatus from regularly wearing one. I tried the Apple Watch for awhile, but I grew tired of having to charge it nightly, and the plethora of features packed into it tended to make it more difficult to use than necessary (your mileage may vary, of course). I wore the inexpensive, lightweight Casio F-91W for a while and mostly enjoyed it, but its quirks eventually made me decide to find something else. I decided to try the fancy (for me, anyway) Casio G-Shock GWM5610, and while I loved the features, I absolutely hated how difficult the buttons were to press. They\u2019re recessed and very stiff, which would make my life difficult if I actually wanted to use the watch.Then I saw an old friend on Amazon: the Timex Ironman Classic 30. I had completely forgotten about it over the years, but I ordered it and it\u2019s everything I remember. Comfier and easier to read than the Casios I\u2019ve tried (I don\u2019t know why Casio insists on small screens). Rugged. Feature-packed (3 alarms with differing ringtones, support for 3 time zones, nice Indiglo backlight, and a primitive occasion calendar I remember loving before I had a cell phone). These features are all intuitive to use, and they don\u2019t get in the way. It fits like an old shoe, and I do believe my search for a watch is over.Don\u2019t sleep on Timex, guys. Casio gets all the glory when it comes to digital watches, but Timex will treat you better.",

You can barely see the digital time stamp, and you have to actually push a button for the face to light up. Not practical for me as I am always working with patients and cannot reach over to push the \u201clight up\u201d button. My old Ironman had a movement sensor so when you rotated the watch to see the time, it would light up the indiglo automatically. So I decided to return this watch. There is nothing wrong with it, but it seems to be just a mediocre/lesser version of the once great Timex Ironman. The pictures show the watch in its lit up Iniglo blue state, but you must push a button and it barely stays lit before turning off again. And it does not light up as the pictures describe.No.Not for me.The face is good decent size. Im a girl but like the bigger sporty faces, but the only problem is that the strap is too big if you have smaller wrists. One can tighten it snug enough, but then you have considerable remaining length dangling beyond the band strap.I\u2019m sure this watch is a good find for sone, but for me it was a return. And not to mention though- when you return this, they do not credit you right away, instead they take their time \u201creceiving it and crediting your account- like to the tune of 3+ weeks.No thank you.",

Such is the case with this Timex Ironman watch. I honestly can\u2019t remember \u2013 but I believe the first one lasted 10 + years. The only noticeable change I can see is a slightly different watch band. Also, toss in kudos to Amazon shipping who had it in a locker two days earlier than expected.What I don\u2019t like\u2026 It seems that ever since the pandemic, everything has at least doubled in price \u2013 if not more. I can remember when places like CVS and Walgreens sold Timex watches for around $20.00. And you could get it the same day instead of waiting on shipping. Now, if you can find one locally, it\u2019s priced much higher than Amazon. Insert sigh and rolling eyes here.",

I much would prefer a nylon strap or a selection to pick from, esp. considering this $29 \"Lightning deal\" price.I do however like how the screen is recessed to protect it from scratches unlike the 50-cents cheaper Expedition model i had.",

It was not easy to fix the watchband back on. The problem was not the watch itself it was where where the holes where the spring is supposed to go. One hole was not the right size compared to the other hole so I had take my small little flathead screwdriver and make the hole a little bigger so finally the other spring would finally fit in the right way. All it all I love the watch but I didn't like that I had to fix the watch just to finally get the watch band nice and secure finally. I don't blame the seller for this. The company that made the watch should have it inspected and made sure that the watch band doesn't come off at all when putting the spring in.",

He plays bball and goes to the court, so he needed a watch to know what time to be home. He chose the \u201cblack/gray/negative\u201d colored one. He says it\u2019s \u201cOk, does the job.\u201d Lol. I\u2019m sure he wishes he had his phone instead! Anyway, the backlight is kind of a joke; it\u2019s not bright but gets the job done. It fit my skinny 105lb kid\u2019s wrist just fine. Instructions are not included in the pamphlet which is annoying. You have to go to timex.com which I did but couldn\u2019t find the set up instructions. I googled/watched you tube video on how to set up Timex model #xxxxx and all was well. It was pretty easy. It\u2019s a watch what can I say? I just need it to tell time so my son doesn\u2019t find himself in more trouble.",

Functions I will never use and seem to get in the way. While working on something that involves contact with my arm, the displayed function will change and I have a devil of a time getting it back to the basic time display. Probably a lot of good features here, but they are lost on me. If you are in need of a multi-function time piece, this may be your ticket. I just couldn't recommend it as a \"basic teller of time.\"",
