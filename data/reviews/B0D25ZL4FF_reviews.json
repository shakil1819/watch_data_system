I was able to easily set it up on the app, however, I noticed many times it just not logging things. It said I didn't sleep at all when I had been sleeping for hours, the step tracker doesn't log all steps amd freezes at certain intervals, and the pulse and calorie estimates don't always work. Pulse was reading about half of what it actually was during workouts, it pauses randomly during workouts, and when set to strength training, it only logged 75 calories in an intense one-hour workout. I'm returning. Very disappointing.",

Pros: cost, size, style, water repellent, calling capabilities, charges quickly and holds a charge for 2-3 days with moderate use. Sleep, HR, and Oxygen readers seem to be pretty accurate",

O2 & heart rate seemed to work fine but it was missing a big important health monitoring feature most of all smart watches should have which is blood pressure monitoring it has everything(heart rate, sleep & O2) except blood pressure which I was kind of hoping it would have or at least be able to add. Otherwise good display, connecting to phone was a little wonky but does work eventually through their app. Will be returning for a similar smartwatch that has blood pressure monitoring.",

It counted me taking steps over the course of the night hours when I was asleep, it also isn't as accurate with my sleep analysis. It still counted me for sleeping although I was already up for a good 30-40 minutes?? Like a few minutes is fine but that much time counted while awake is crazy. Also, so far the little button on the side (to turn it on and off), you can kinda roll it like a normal watch and what not, but so far, I haven't found it's purpose in being able to turn. It also doesn't register touch very well on the screen. Sometimes I have to press more than once for my music to come on and what not. I HAVE tried calling and it works pretty well so that's good. I've walked outside and it's pretty bright, and I can see, it also has a pretty good battery thus far, it's been over 10 hours after the first charge and it's going well. But keep in mind it's because I was sleeping. But anyways, the band strap is pretty good quality so my wrist isn't being destroyed which is good. Pretty easy set up with the app and what not, BUT, the app and the syncing is kinda slow. I had to update it 4 times for it to properly load my sleep analysis.Will update once I have used it longer.",

I don't mind that it doesn't measure blood pressure as my bp is always good. It can measure blood oxygen as often as you like automatically. I also wanted one that could make/receive calls. Just sync with your contacts. Make sure to allow all permissions for it on your phone. And sleep monitoring is a must for me. It displays the current local temperature, something my last one didn't do properly. It has Many exercises to choose from. Many watch faces too, though I like the default face. You can make a custom background pic if you want, but it will only display pulse, time, date, and day. It is easy to sync and set up if you know basic phone settings. The band color is a quite unique light purple. It got here in 1 day in an Amazon box. I got a similar one for my daughter",
