Overall, it\u2019s a great piece of tech and I like his software keeps adding innovative features, while hardware still maintains a small but incremental change approach. Not a \u2018must buy\u2019, if you are on series 8 or 9.",

So, the first thing I noticed was how much CLEARER the face was! Not just bigger (I went from 40 mm to 42mm) but so much clearer, and brighter and easier to read. The second thing was, how might LIGHTER it feels on my wrist...almost as if nothing is there. Even with the face protector, it is so much lighter than the 6. As for the battery, I charge it to 100% (quick charge!) and wear it all day and night, and it still has a decent amount of charge in it. But I still charge it each morning so I can wear it all day and night again.I chose the GPS + Cellular model this time because, being a bit older and not always near my phone, I wanted the watch to be able to work on its own in an emergency.As for apps, I haven't had much time to try them all out, but the ones I did use have more functionality than before. I did notice a lot more ways, like an emoji app, to customize texting and messaging. Calls are nice and clear as well. There are also more ways to customize each app to your own preferences. And there are a lot more watch faces to choose from.Yes, I am an Apple person - iPhones, watches, iPads, MacBooks, and I just love the way everything interfaces.All in all, I LOVE my new Apple Watch and totally worth the investment.",

Not quite 5 stars.Upgrading from a series 9, (yes I know not much of an upgrade) you can tell there is a difference in build quality. The button and wheel feel sturdier, the sensor on the back is slightly flatter, and the bevel of the screen is flatter. I did however end up using my old band, but the sport loop is nice too! Not much to say in terms of apps or software. The faster charging has been nice since I use it for sleep tracking, after I wake up I throw it on charge to get ready and pick it back up at full battery before I leave. I would say if you have a series 7 or older it would be worth the upgrade, but if you\u2019re still rocking an 8 or 9 it\u2019s not quite worth it yet.",

                        "content": "I recently decided to upgrade from the watch SE for some of the additional features available on the series 10 such as the temperature sensor for my Natural Cycles app and the ECG capabilities.I ended up choosing the series 10 because of the size. I have very small wrists and old eyes so while the smaller size fit better, the larger one was easier for me to see and navigate. At 42mm it is finally the exact right size for me.I switched from the Watch SE 2nd gen 44mm to this and was surprised that even though it is smaller and thinner the battery actually lasts longer. My Watch SE was usually down to around 50% or less at the end of my day where my Watch 10 is usually above 60% so there's definitely something the chip is doing effectively as the display is being used more often and still exceeding the battery life of the larger watch.This is my first of the non SE watches so I can't say if it worth upgrading from a series 8 or 9. But If you've been using something earlier or the SE like me, this is definitely worth it.",
