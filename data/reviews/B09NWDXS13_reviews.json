It looks just like a brand new one. So easy to pair with my phone, keeps a great charge and works like a charm. Very informative health and fitness tracking, text, talk,everything you do on your phone can be done on this watch. Good value!",

From a cosmetic perspective, it appeared brand new. My only disappointment is that the battery capacity was only 83% which means that I will only get about a year with this battery before it will need to be replaced. However, the price was substantially lower than a new one so I guess it was a fair trade off.",

That watch worked fine for 2 years but was stolen recently so I bought this refurb iWatch 7 on Amazon. Apple has made changes now so the iWatch 7 will no longer pair to an iPhone 8. Why. Because the iPhone 8 cannot go up to version IOS 17, WHICH THE iWatch 7 now requires or it will not pair!! I got Amazon on the phone and they confirmed it to be true so after trying everything to get around the problem, I finally had to return the watch. If you have an iPhone 8 or less, don't waste your time with this.",

The most recent was a 7, and it looks practically brand new. I can only see one tiny little scratch near the turn dial. It has 90% max battery capacity, which I think is pretty darn good for a used watch that\u2019s a few years old. Works perfectly, paired easily, is just what I ordered. I will order from this vendor again in the future. Very happy to have an older model refurbished watch for half the price of new.",

All the buttons and knobs work and so does the heart rate sensor. It arrived dead but charged rather quickly with the supplied charger and paired with my phone in minutes. I originally purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend because new ones are so expensive so I am off to find a empty apple box to put this in so she\u2019s none the wiser I cheaper out lol.

Or if using the fast charger is good for the battery over time anyway. Also, the Oxygen sensor is disabled.

Saw these renewed ones for a fraction of the price. I ordered one and 2 days later, it showed up. It was in a plain box and had a charger with it. Good thing because it was dead as I\u2019ve ever seen anything dead. It charged up in an hour or so I could get it set up.I inspected it. There are wear marks on the case and crown but the face was fine. I put a screen and case protector on it and it looks fine.I checked the battery life and it\u2019s down to 85%. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s going to be fine. I know it can be replaced it I want to later.The sports band is not an Apple product but I don\u2019t care. I quit buying Apple Watch bands years ago. I can buy 3 or 4 of these perfectly fine knockoffs for the price of one Apple.Other than the scuffs and battery it works as it should.Down with overpriced stuff and thumbs up for cheaper rebuilt semi quality stuff. Kinda like a rebuilt transmission.*****UPDATE*****As for the functionality of the watch, it's fine except for the battery life. I have to charge it part way through the day IF I want it to last all day. On more than one occasion, by 4:00 pm, I got the 10% battery left message and then it is dead until I get it on a charger. Now, I'm going to have to spend $100 to get the battery replaced.AND - the watch charger that came with it, does not work. Yes, I took the piece of plastic off of it before trying it out. I'm beginning to regret my purchase.I guess I could see if I can replace the battery myself but I don't want to perform surgery on a piece of electronics at my age. The battery will be around $25 and the tool kit will be around $30 plus shipping and handling. Still saving money though. Maybe I can start a side hustle replacing apple watch batteries and save enough to go on vacation in the tropics or buy a small can of pineapple juice.Buyers remorse is setting in. REMOVE A STAR!*****UPDATE #2*****Found a video tutorial that walked me through turning off a number of the functions of the watch to save on battery. I am pleased to report that after doing that, I can now wear it 10 or 11 hours and the watch will still have mid 70's battery left. I shouldn't have to do this but I did so Now I can wear it and not worry about taking a charger to work with me so I can charge it over my lunch break.",

That is a disappointment. It took over an hour to charge to 44% and stopped from temperature protection.The condition was excellent, just tiny spots around the aluminum that are not really noticeable. The glass is perfect.Battery health is 86%. That's about what I expected.This is a series 7 so the blood oxygen sensor should work since it is not sold by Apple. However, mine is disabled. This was one of the main reasons I got the watch so it is a real let-down. Is this a mistake?The watch itself is nice and much faster than my old one, which is still working but no longer gets updates past watchOS 6.3. I love the larger display.",

Buying online, you never really know what \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d quality means. I bought a \u201cexcellent\u201d quality watch. Here\u2019s what that looks like:The screen on this refurbished watch is perfect, but the crown is more scratched than my series 4. Also, the battery health on this refurbished watch says it can only hold 85% of a charge (which presumably means 15.3 hours of battery life on a \u201cfull\u201d charge as opposed to the original 18). In contrast, my series 4 is at 79% (about 14.2 hours on a \u201cfull\u201d charge). I know batteries degrade over time, but I was surprised to see a number this low on a 2-year-old watch.I wish I\u2019d known about the battery health, but it\u2019s not a huge deal as I charge daily anyway. The performance upgrade from the 4 to the 7 is amazing. I had so much lag on the 4 that any watch face with widgets was useless as they took over 10 seconds to appear. Lastly, I guess I feel good for the planet for buying used.",

Even though the series 7 was released in 2021, it works perfectly and the series 8 isn\u2019t different enough to justify the price difference. On the downside though, the rubber sport band can hurt if you have a lot of hair in your wrist and you put it on too tight. Lastly, the 45mm size is perfect for me as I am 6\u20191\u201d and have decently sized wrists that aren\u2019t too huge.Seller (loop mobile) was great, even though the delivery took a while even though it was coming from Indiana when I live in CA.

The watch shipped faster than expected and came in a non-apple box containing both a medium large and medium small apple sport band. The included charger was a non-apple puck made of all plastic, instead of the aluminum one that ships with the watch normally. The watch itself was in perfect condition, as expected. After through inspection there was no visible damage and all the sensors were fully functional.

The battery health was at 100% which was very surprising. overall a great value for the money with a few minor downsides.",
