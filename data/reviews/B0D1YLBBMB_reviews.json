                        "content": "My Galaxy (4) watch was ready for an upgrade!I always do my research and read the reviews before I buy a product. This purchase was no different. I was somewhat concerned with a number of reviewers complaining that the battery was not good and didn't last long. So, I want to address that concern first.With all of my watches I never use the Always on Display function. I realize that the watch faces are beautiful on the Galaxy Screen. However, those beautiful bright LED's use power. If you leave them on all the time you can expect maximum battery drain. I have everything turned on except the AOD. Yesterday I used my watch a lot as I was playing and experimenting with all the cool features. Wore it through the night to monitor my sleep. This morning at 6 a.m. I had used a total of 27 percent of battery power for a 24 hour period! At this rate of power usage I can expect 3+ days of use. Battery life doesn't concern me at all.SETUP (Stars*****)I was expecting to make a trip to my service provider because I use the LTE version. I figured I could do all the setup minus the phone provider portion at home. I was extremely impressed with the setup/switch procedure. Simple, straight forward and quick!I was pleased at how simple and easy the setup was. As soon as I was done I needed to let my dogs out for a walk. While I was out walking the girls my Watch rang! I answered it and had a nice conversation. The switch feature swapped over and set up all of my LTE functions without the need to spend half a day at my phone providers location!DIGITAL RING VERSUS PHYSICAL (Stars *****)I never really liked the physical ring all that much. The new digital ring is awesome! Good job Samsung!CHARGING (Stars *****)Charges extremely fast with the little charger that comes with the watch. This small charger is great for travel. I ordered a couple more.FITNESS (Stars *****)I'm still using them and can only say that so far they are still the award winning excersize App/sensors they have always been.AI (Stars *****)Wow! This opens up a whole new experience with my watch. I use Alexa to do so many things now. The ability to put Alexa on my watch is a real game changer. Don't worry, if you prefer Google assistant you can use that as well.ASTHETICS (Stars *****)I think Samsung could have done a better job with the advertisement pics out there. I was initially disappointed at how the Galaxy 7 looked. When I actually got the watch I happily realized the pics don't do it justice. I think that this is the most aesthetically pleasing watch Samsung has made to date.THE BAND (Stars ***)Nope. I knew I didn't like the watch band it comes with from the pics. If you want an extra you can have mine. I ordered a watch band from Wingle to match the silver of the watch. Wow! They are a perfect match and look gorgeous!I couldn't be happier! What a great Smartwatch. When you pair this watch with the Samsung family of devices it is in a class of it's own!OVERALL: Five Stars!RECOMMEND?: Absolutely YES!",

They go beyond Fitbit's features and you don't have to pay for extra services or data that you don't need.I find it easy to use, but I spent some time to find out all it can do.My only quibble is battery life. I'm used to a 4-5 day charge with the Fitbit. I'm getting used to the 1-1.5 day charge with this one. But it does charge quickly and I don't use a lot of extras that drain the battery (notifications, phone, apps).",

I keep it on a mode where the face only activates when you raise your wrist or hit the button or screen. I assume that saves significant battery power. That being said, I use mine at work all day and basically use it to keep me up to date on emails, texts, etc. without needing to use my phone. After about 16 hours it is still on average 70% = 75% battery, So... I charge it every other day. I don't like sleeping with a watch so I charge mine overnight.It is a very comfortable watch as well. No complaints with the stock band. I wanted black and it was actually a greenish band, but it looks nice.",

                        "content": "I am upgrading my trusty Samsung Active 2, which is still going strong but is lagging just enough to become a bit of a nuisance, and the sensors are maybe accurate 80% of the time now. I bought this watch 5 years ago, so the upgrade jump for me is pretty big.I have been playing with the device for a day, and here is my experience so far:**Pros:**- Easy setup: My Samsung phone recognized the watch immediately and began the pairing and updating process.- Helpful tutorial: The straightforward tutorial taught me the basics for operating the watch. It was a bit different from my Active 2, so it was appreciated. You can skip it, but it only takes about 30 seconds.- Easy customization: I backed up my data from my previous watch and selected a pleasant watch face immediately.- Fast charging, quick response times, good framerate.- More screen with the same size: Reduced bezels compared to the Active 2.- Better resolution.- The sensor light is not a blinding bright green flash like on the Active 2.- Lighter than my previous watch.- Accurate sensors: I enjoy how many more features it has.- I like the Samsung Health App: It feels condensed and easy to navigate.**Neutral:**- It's about as thick as my previous watch, which I had hoped would be thinner.- Battery life is average but may improve with use. It depends on which sensors and apps you use.- Custom workouts: I tried building one, and it was a decent experience, though it needs some fine-tuning.- Not sure how AI plays a role yet; more testing is needed.**Cons:**- It's expensive for what it is: a health tracker that can make calls.- Minimal upgrade from a Samsung 6: The features and overall design are very similar.- Limited color options and ugly bands (this may change in the future). I used my own case and band to make it more my own.**Final Thoughts:**I primarily use my watch as a health tracker for steps, sleep monitoring, HR, etc. I'm excited to have something more accurate than before. This watch is really only worth it if you intend to use it for health tracking and want seamless integration with your Samsung phone. I rarely use my watch to reply to phone calls or emails.I'm satisfied with my purchase, but this comes from someone making a big jump from one device to another, based on initial impressions. I may update the review after more use, especially if I notice anything major.**So, do I recommend it?**It depends on your needs. Do you need a health tracker and don't mind paying extra to be in the Samsung Ecosystem? Are you upgrading from a recent model?If you don't mind the price, then yes, get it. I like having devices that work well together, but I wouldn't recommend this watch if you're upgrading from last year's model (Samsung 6). The AI isn't advanced or prominent enough to warrant such a small upgrade.**TLDR:**Recommended for big upgrade jumps, to be in the Samsung ecosystem, and for use as a health tracker. Not recommended or wait for a sale if upgrading from Samsung 6 or wanting just new \"AI\" features.",

                        "content": "I ordered us to watch sevens in the 44 mm size which was excellent. I ordered it in the watch and band the combination for the same price.We still have not received or two bands for the two watches we ordered it does come with the default military green colored one for each but the White Band the material we would prefer and hopefully longer has not yet been received August 2nd estimate delivery for one of them is on the 8th another the 10th so it's a long waiting period to get the Bands. That is a bit disappointing however they are discounted down so that both together equal the same price as just the watch.So far I use it for the EKG in auction saturation as I do have breathing issues and have recently had a cold the cause of breathing issues. I tested to an actual pulse oximeter the results have been extremely close and accurate. I'm having difficulty I can monitor my saturation and do breathing techniques to improve it if it is low.I recommend that people turn off the always on display. As this is a battery drainer and you won't get more than a day if it's on. But turn it off and when you have the rotate wrist feature on when you rotate your wrist you'll see the display but it will turn off when it's not rotated up and it saves battery.As a note if your phone has Wi-Fi calling on which is very handy for using Xfinity mobile, your phone does not have to be in your pocket or next to you when you are in the house you can use the watch to make calls anywhere you're within the Wi-Fi range in your house. So I can leave the phone in the bedroom and just wear the watch and be out on the back patio and still receiving a calls even with just the Bluetooth Wi-Fi model.",

The database to look up calories is expansive. I don't really use to make calls or emails, but I know it does this. I love the fitness and health aspects of it! People complain about the battery life, which is not ideal. It is super easy to set and customize goals, change screens, apps, etc. My negatives include that sometimes the count is off when I do situps. In addition, during my workout, if seems to switch screens more easily than I woudl like. I definitely recommend it!",

But apparently I don\u2019t move my arms enough (even when walking normally) for it to register my steps). I tested it against multiple other methods.I am not vain enough that I need it to say I walked a ton of steps but it kept chiding me for being so inactive. (I have a condition. Walking is what I can do. I don\u2019t need it making me feel bad). So, as much as I liked it, it was a deal breaker.It seemed a little heavy too, compared to my Apple Watch.Just my experience.",

Reason I only gave it 4 stars is you CANNOT charge this version on the back of your phone with power sharing like previous versions, not a huge deal, I charge mine every evening before bed. Also, I have a subscription to YouTube music, this watch only seems to want to play Spotify. The charge the first day was awful, but after that, I've found the battery lasts longer than the Watch 5. Also you can use the same bands you already have if you have a Watch 4 or higher. I would recommend this watch if you're looking to upgrade. I have a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra phone, so features work very well with phone.",

Three weeks in and she's donated all her off-brand watches to the thrift store.I upgraded from the Galaxy Watch S3 Frontier to the Watch 4 Classic skipping 5 and 6 because they weren't a significant enough upgrade from the 4. I miss the physical rotating bezel, the virtual bezel works ok but on the Watch 7 the face glass goes all the way to the edge so I feel like what would have been a simple bump for Watch 3 and 4 will likely crack the glass. Never-the-less the display is far clearer, and you can definitely feel the increased performance of the hardware",

It's currently using the ringtone called \"Shiver\" however there are NO settings using that ringtone on my watch, and I can't stand that ringtone. My previous watch is the Galaxy Watch 4, which the exact same app uses the ringtone you set for the watch.This is a known issue and is the same for all Galaxy Watch 7's. Disappointing they haven't fixed it, as I use that app multiple times a day. Quite a pricy watch for them to force the use of their ringtone on us. I would have stayed with my Galaxy Watch 4 had I known. Fix this and it's worth changing my review to 5 stars.",
