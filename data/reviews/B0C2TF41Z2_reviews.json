The dial is easy to read (day/night), feels solid with just the right amount of heft... I even like the wristband. I can't remember the last time I didn't feel the need to order a separate NATO style wristband for a new watch purchase (I average around 2 years per watch before something catastrophic happens). If I had to say something negative, it is a little hard to read the date. That's a common complaint with me though and not worth deducting a star over. Comes nicely packaged in it's own cloth envelope.",

Worst of all this is a $13.99 watch (plus tax of course) and my Amazon credit card shows billing over $45 for this thing and I have no idea how to try to get that mischarge removed from my Amazon card. I'm sending it back and I have been told that I'll get credit for the $13.99 but hey what about this over-billing? All of this craziness because I simply wanted a cheap watch to just tell time to avoid pulling out my cell phone to check the time time.
