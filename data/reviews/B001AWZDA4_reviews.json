                        "content": "Bought this 2 years and 8 months ago and it's still great. In that time, it's drifted 27 seconds (e.g. at 8:00:00 it now reads 8:00:27). **EDIT** This drift is inaccurate. Updated at bottom of review **END EDIT**. For me, that's not a big deal, but figured I'd mention it. I wear the watch face-side down on my wrist, but it only accrued one mild scratch in all that time. Nothing terrible. I bought this watch because it had 3 things; the 24-hour time, the day of the week, and the date on a single screen. It's the only watch I've found that had all 3 of those. To find all 3 in a highly rated and CHEAP watch? I bought it in a second and haven't regretted it since. I actually returned a better and more expensive watch (Casio DW5600E-1V) before eventually finding and loving this. I especially love that it orders the date in Year-Month-Day format. I live in the US where Month-Day-Year is the norm, but I also work with thousands of computer files where the best way to organize files by date is with a Year-Month-Day system (e.g. 221102 for November 2, 2022). It's just a little nothing thing, but I love this watch for it.I should note that the watch band snapped off back in August, 2 years and 5 months after getting the watch. That's happened with other watches with resin bands that I've owned, always around the 2-3 year mark. I heard it's from sweat or showers hardening the resin or something. That could make sense as I never take mine off except when I'm rock climbing. Regardless, I just grabbed a cheap 18mm silicone watch strap for 12.99 and it's been fine ever since (bought silicone because I heard they don't snap. I'll update this if it ever does).I plan to use this watch forever. If it breaks, I'll buy a new one for the price of a burger + onion rings. I've gone through a dozen watches over the past 25 years or so, but this is the first one that I loved. It has everything I want without a bunch of other useless expensive crap that I'll never use (looking at you, altimeter; and that's coming from a hiker). It's cheap, reliable (anecdotally), has a fast band replacement process, no feature-bloat, has large text, and is DECENTLY water resistant. The only downside is that the watch isn't 200m water resistant. If it was, it'd be perfect for me. Anyway, I don't go surfing/swimming with it, but it hasn't fogged up after 2+ years of showers, rain, sweat, etc. If you want a cheap watch, I recommend this one (unless you're an avid surfer). Or if you're like me and willing to fork over $100 for a watch, maybe buy this anyway. It's certainly much better than the $21 price-tag would have you believe.**EDIT** 12/12/23I made the above review over a year ago, but I realized that I couldn't verify that the 27 seconds of drift was accurate. Well, I decided to run a little experiment over the past year and record the drift every few months (basically whenever I remembered I was even doing this) and it turns out that the drift WASN'T accurate. After a year, my watch drifted 58 seconds. To get that 27 second value, I might have reset my watch whenever we had daylight saving time or something, hence the inaccurate drift. Anyway, I included the recorded values below (MM/DD/YY format) in case someone is interested. Also, I used time.gov for the baseline comparison.12/11/22 9:55PM - 0 seconds fast01/19/23 6:18PM - 5 seconds fast02/22/23 12:48PM - 10.5 seconds fast04/15/23 9:00PM - 18.5 seconds fast05/08/23 8:22PM - 22 seconds fast06/27/23 12:52PM - 30 seconds fast09/06/23 8:15PM - 41 seconds fast11/05/23 7:18PM - 51 seconds fast12/11/23 9:55PM - 58 seconds fastThis basically means my watch drifts by a little more than 1 second every week (1sec/~6.29days). For my needs, that's fine. I'm not doing anything in my daily life that requires long-term precision to the second, and I have to reset it every so often anyway for the aforementioned daylight saving time, so I don't mind at all. Other than that, the watch still works great (nearing 4 years now) and the \"new\" silicone watchband is still great too (although it hasn't hit that 2-3 year breakdown point yet). So, all in all, still happy with it.",

                        "content": "I have been using this for a few weeks. I've done a couple hikes that included cliff jumping, climbing, and water for multiple hours. I took it scuba diving for two days and we were in the ocean constantly. It held up perfectly. I dove for two days averaging 30-40 feet deep but 65 at the deepest. It did great for all of that. I used the stopwatch underwater multiple times. The display is crisp and clear. Buttons are perfect size. Easy to push even with scuba gloves but they don't dig into your wrist. The light works great. It doesn't stay on for more than a second unless you hold it but I like that. Less battery wasting. The strap is a little long. I have small wrists so I cut it shorter. I regretted that in a thick 7ml wetsuit when the long strap would have been nice, but it still worked. I've seen others exhange the straps. The alarm is enough to wake up with. It beeps 10 times and then stops. It will go again every 5 minutes if you have the snooze setting on. So far I have one tiny scratch on the surface. Only noticeable if you really look for it. That's pretty good for the abuse I've already put it through. My favorite part about it is that it replaces having to get my phone out or turned on for time, stopwatch, and alarm while I'm backpacking/hiking/diving. People think that you need to have expensive gear to have fun outside and that's usually not true.",

                        "content": "UPDATED AT THE END***This Casio rocks. I read up on watches for a few weeks (yes, I'm neurotic like that) before purchasing. Even checking out $120 Seiko Automatic watches, et cetera. I settled on this digital watch because it is a die-hard, long-lasting, easy-to-use, and easy-to-read watch.A few months later? I am stoked!Let's address the elephant in the room first: The lens scratches easily. Yes and No. It does get scratched when I bang it hard against drywall or concrete while I'm working. But it is SUPER easy to fix. I just put a dab of toothpaste on a cloth and rub it against the lens for a few seconds, then rinse it under water. The scratch is gone. I've done this twice now and the watch looks brand new.The display is bright at night. The alarm wakes me up. The watch itself has only gained 2 seconds over the course of 3 months (I check it against an atomic clock everyday at work.)I would recommend this watch to anybody that isn't too proud to rock a durable little digital wristwatch. The display is amazing: Show the name of the day, full date, time (including seconds), as well as whether the alarm, snooze, and signal modes are activated. Comfortable band, doesn't get smelly like leather.I have HUGE wrists. I'm 6' 3\" and have large hands and this watch fits me great. Could easily tighten up several notches for people with normal sized wrists.It's not that classy looking, but it is a tank. I feel naked if I leave the house without it now. Just like my pocketknife.***UPDATED***Band is crap. Time piece is still great. About 2 years after purchasing the band completely fell apart. I kept it together with super glue and electrical tape for about the last 6 month's of the band's life. It cracked and split A LOT. The watch itself will last for years, but not on my wrist, unfortunately. It is cheaper to buy another watch than to get a replacement band. Is this what economists refer to as Planned Obsolescence?***Another update: after 3 years the barn is toast again. I will keep buying this watch. I'm in love with this model. I have no doubt the timepiece will last for the full ten years as advertised. The bands are 3 years tops. I still have my older watches from years past relegated to backpacks and glove boxes.",

Unlike ISO 8601, the month and day are not zero-padded, so it shows 2024 4- 1 instead of 2024-04-01 for April 1st, 2024. The date is all on one line (at the bottom) and clearly visible. It also says the day of the week, for example \"SUN\", as three letters and fairly large. The only other Casio I know of that displays such full date information, including the year, is the DBC-32 calculator watch, which isn't even water resistant. This watch is 100 meters water resistant, and differs in quite a few other respects.I also like that it shows the time (hour and minute) in the lower line no matter which screen you are on (aside from the main screen, where the time is the main line). This feature is also shared by the DBC-32, but is slightly more common among Casios.It has an alarm with snooze, which is not so common. It also has a month and day filter for the alarm, which seems unlikely to be useful, especially since there is only 1 alarm, not the 5 alarms that are common on Casio watches with the month and day options for the alarm. I find this can be useful for storing information, especially when combined with the 10-year battery life.The features are sparse:Main timekeeping screenAlarm and hourly chime screenStopwatchDual timeThere is no count-down alarm, which disappointed me.I am also slightly disappointed by the backlight. It seems to be around 3 seconds, which is nice, but it is just one LED in the lower left corner. It does only a mediocre job at illuminating the screen - it is not evenly lit, but it is definitely all visible. With only one LED, sometimes the alignment is off and you really can't see the whole screen, if you have bad luck and get a watch with poor alignment.I am also slightly disappointed with the strap, which cannot be folded flat for storage because it has little wedges jutting out in back that keep in in a C shape when not being worn.I think this watch is exceptionally well suited to be a travel alarm clock, especially if you may be disoriented, because it has a backlight, the year-month-day and day of week (which I find I forget when I am just waking up in less than ideal settings), and a SNOOZE ALARM, which I would not really trust a wrist watch alarm without. However, the Casio W-212H is my favorite watch with a snooze alarm, it has a better backlight, it also shows the day of week month and day (but not year), and it has a count-down timer with auto-repeat.I got this watch at a substantial discount, though.

It works. It has everything I need in a watch. It withstands getting banged into things, being hit and all the temperature, liquid, and whatever that I've put it through over the years and kept going. For an inexpensive watch, it looks nice as well.I only gave it four stars because of the watch band. The band looks nice, it's comfortable, doesn't catch on much and lasts a while. However, over time it gets hard, then brittle. This is due I believe to body heat slowly causing a change in the material. Or maybe it will get that way eventually on it's own. Then it will break. The keeper usually goes first, then one side or the other of the watch band.Amazon has replacement keepers and bands that match this watch and they aren't expensive to purchase and the new bands come with the tool to change the spring that holds them in place. I now have several of them. And, since they break one side at a time, you only have to change one side at a time. You don't need to change the whole band.I easily recommend this watch if you are looking for something inexpensive that just works and keeps on working. Learn to replace your own band and the cost over time will still give you better value over more expensive watches.",

The two models are identical in function. I prefer the original with a slightly narrower profile and less conspicuous black buttons but like the flatter face of the new one. The original has slightly larger numbers on the display but both are easily readable.",

                        "content": "I like the feature rich nature of this watch, especially at this price. But for those not into feature rich digital watches there are more basic watches to consider. This watch includes the year as well as the month and day which means it always knows the current calendar of days in the month and leap years. I enjoy not having to adjust for those changes. It's important to carefully read the manual to learn the functions of each button for each mode. Each button is labeled, for example the mode button allows you to move from regular watch to alarm to stop-watch very quickly. The 12/24 (lower right) button while in regular watch mode allows quickly switching between 12 hour and 24-hour time. In Stopwatch the 12/24 button starts and stop the timing and the (top left) adjust button sets the stopwatch back to zero. It may take a little time to become familiar with all the features and if you only want an inexpensive digital watch, you may not choose to use these other features. I do urge that you use the instruction manual to set the year, month and day along with the time. Note, this watch is not a new release and has been around several years and may not have the support newer Casio digital watches have available. It does promote a 10 yr. battery, but I have no way of knowing how long ago this watch was made and/or how long the battery has been installed. In a few years I'll have a better idea. However, the coin cell is reported to be a CR 2025 which is a commonly available battery if I need a replacement. I've only had this one a month and so far, it's working find. It is supposed to be accurate to about 30 seconds a month or better, but I haven't had enough time to test this particular unit. Water resistance is supposed to be 100 meters but I haven't tested it. It's not a dive watch, so I personally wouldn't take it surfing or in water more than surface swimming. The four-screw back plate creates a lot of surface area for potential leaks as the seal ages.",

Does not come stock with a countdown timer. Although you can (and I did) YouTube a quick guide on how to add one. Really easy and completely transforms the functionality of the watch.2. The LED green light is not the BEST, but better than most. In my opinion, the orange LED from the Casio AE-1200WH would have been a huge upgrade.If Casio would have made this watch with the above 2 things, this watch would have been a 5 star +++ major home run and I would have gladly purchased for even double the price. Other than those 2 things, and at around 20 bucks, this watch is unbeatable. Digits are easy to read, 100m is plenty of water resistance, it's lightweight, and not too big or too small. Straps are easy to remove and upgrade as shown in my pictures/video. Honestly what more do you really need? The biggest positive in my opinion is the ability to show the current time while you are in stop watch or (the manually added) count down timer mode. This is something the overly hyped TikTok and YouTube viral AE-1200WH aka \"Casio Royal\" lacks.Overall, very solid purchase and extremely useful. Next best thing outside of the G-Shock 5600E-1V.",

When I travel out of the country I use the the dual time feature to show my destination time as well as my home time. The wrist band is nice and long to fit wrists of any size. I like that it has a light. I'm a swimmer use the stopwatch to track how long I swim. I also free dive when snorkeling and appreciate that it's water resistant to 100 meters. I once lost one when hiking out of my favorite remote campsite. When I returned a year later after a Michigan winter, I found it and it was still running with the accurate time. Hard to go wrong with this watch!",

It was a bit simpler feature-wise than the others, but I liked that the strap/case design on this was the most sleek looking. I\u2019ve showered with it and no problem. But wouldn\u2019t try swimming with it. Watch can beep every hour and I like that I can shut that off when need be. If you\u2019re looking for an everyday watch this is the best bet, and you can\u2019t beat the price!",

Other than that, I like the watch for this price point.: update, my dog jumped up on me and just grazed my watch with his claw, but it left a deep gouge on the acrylic window, making difficult to even read.

                        "content": "I just got my watch yesterday, and after a full day of use, I am happy to report that this is a very solid all-around watch. I got this to replace my previous daily driver, the Timex Men's T49997 Expedition Gallatin Black Fast Wrap Velcro Strap Watch , which started giving up on me after nearly two years of usage. I wanted an inexpensive watch to replace this one, and since I don't really go to any fancy meetings or upscale restaurants, and when I do, I have the appropriate watches for those events. I needed something that take a hit against the occasional door if necessary. Looks weren't really that important to me. Seeing this watch on sale for less than $10, with a boatload of positive reviews, I knew I had to jump on it.When I first got the watch, I expected it to arrive in very simply packaging, nothing too fancy, especially at the price I paid for it. It came in a nice little blue box, and while it wasn't the most premium packaging, it certainly didn'nt seem as though the watch I purchased was cheap by any means. Seeing the big Casio logo on it also reminded me that despite the price I paid, this was supposed to be a quality, durable product, and all of that was confirmed for me the moment I pulled the watch out of the packaging.Its design isn't anything to write home about, and neither are the materials that went into making the watch (no fancy gold here!), but the rubberized strap seemed to go hand-in-hand with the material of the watch's face. The uniform black coloring on the watch makes it look utilitarian, but distinctive at the same time. It might not impress anyone at a party, but then again, that wasn't my intention when purchasing the watch.The two most important functions of a watch for me are its ability to tell the time and its durability. The screen on the watch isn't a 1440p Super AMOLED display with RGB coloring around the mantle, but for the purpose of simply telling time, it is phenomenal! Anyone who owned a digital watch in the 90s will know how it looks. The grayscale image is clear, and the text is extremely easy to read, especially in bright daylight. The time is in a font that's large enough for anyone with moderate eyesight to understand, and the watch even tells us the date, time and day of the week! The watch has other functions like \"Alarm\" \"Stopwatch\" and \"Timer,\" but I haven't tested any of those modes out, so I won't mention them here (still, it's nice to know they're available!).Overall, from what little time I've spent with the watch, I can easily say I'm more than satisfied with it. Casio has given the battery a life expectancy of 10 years, but well, if it dies before, I'll update this review for us. If you're just looking for an easy watch to understand, something practical and durable, then look no further, especially if you can find it for less than $10!",
