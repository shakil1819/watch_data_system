I like the gold/brass color of the case and the clarity of the glass. The face is easy to read and the cream face color is handsome and a nice contrast, less glaring than the white my previous Timex had. Setting the date is not a problem, as some other reviews have stated. Once you find the required \u201cmiddle\u201d position of the stem between all the way in and all the way out, it becomes pretty natural and is easy to remember. Speaking of the date, I wish they kept the day of the week presentation that my previous Timex had, but that\u2019s a relatively small disappointment. The band is excellent. It\u2019s a soft suede-like leather that\u2019s very flexible. The trim stitching is very well done; straight, even, and all finishings are secured and tucked away so that there are no loose ends or fraying looks. The two belt loops, one fixed close behind the buckle and the other sliding further down the strap are great for keeping the strap close to the wrist. All-in-all, a great buy for the price!",

                        "content": "Timex - hard to beat. Watch arrived in new condition packaged in genuine plastic Timex display/packaging. A sticker on the package states: movement and assembly: Philippines, strap: China. Regarding waterproofing, per the enclosed literature : \" Is water resistant only as long as lens, buttons, and case remain intact;...is not a diver's watch (not to be used for diving );...and the caveat not to push any buttons whilst underwater. It also states 30 meter water resistance; without a screw down winding stem, I would be skeptical of that claim and I personally won't be submerging this particular watch.The watch strap is stamped \"genuine leather upper\"; appears to be good quality, stitched well and blemish free. Changing the date is simple: pull the stem out about less than midway and turn- left or right - until the desired date is shown and push stem back in. The date window is not magnified and quite small, but the date is readable. There is an audible ticking sound. However, my hearing isn't all that hot anymore and I need to put it next to my ear to hear it.The whole watch is fairly light, not like an auto winding Swiss chronograph. The numerals and the hands are black and contrast well against the watch face, the second sweep hand is gold colored. Pushing the stem in activates the Indiglo feature: the watch face is backlight and the numerals and hands are boldly and easily readable.Someone asked if this a knockoff because it is so inexpensive; the Red Bull'seye Store sells the same watch for exactly the same price as on this site. These modest Timex watches are fairly inexpensive and this is no exception.So, if you are looking for an easy to read watch, night or day, doesn't cost too much offered by a brand that has been around since 1854, and has a certain understated style, you might want to consider the Easy Reader watch collection line.",

I look to watches that have a crystal face to prevent scratches, and the comfort of a leather band, and easy to read in day or night. This is not an heirloom watch, but it does just what I want it to do. My only complaint, which is pretty must across all brands, is the date is difficult to read anytime the lighting is low.

Mine is black face with gold accent, which looks more like copper, but I like that since gold might look too gaudy, in my opinion. Brown leather band.This watch gets rinsed with a garden hose or faucet many times each day, and is still ticking without any fogging or condensation. I don't submerge it or shower with it however, nor do I wear it to the beach, due to the low water resistance rating.The night glo feature is visible for about 4 to 5 hours, at least, which I thought would be annoyingly short but turns out it's rarely a problem, although I do wish it was brighter so it would be easier/quicker for my eyes to adjust...I've worn it sleeping and could still see the glow until it was almost dawn.The two little straps that hold the overlapping band... one of them is looking pretty thin and ragged and it might break soon, but the other one is not as bad and will last quite a bit longer.I've used the timer several times just to see if it worked and it seemed to be consistently accurate. On and noticed that two of the three dials zeroed when i pushed the reset. The battery is still going despite that use., the original battery from purchase.My band has paint on it from work and I would like to replace just the band, but the watches are inexpensive so I'm buying another black one and also a white one. I think bands are standard sizes and so I will replace it another day with something cool.In summary, everything about this watch has exceeded my expectations, and it's still working the way it should, and still looking good too.I'm buying two more when I'm done with this review!",
