The alarm is loud enough to hear without my hearing age. This watch does everything I was looking for\u2026 and nothing else. Perfect!

Like a good basic watch with a large easily read screen. Use these primarily for work however I'm starting to enjoy wearing these on my down time. Like the bright turquoise color and it does make a statement. The bright LED backlight works well. Like the optional hourly chime feature. Fits well on wrist and the band is the perfect thickness. The band easily confirms to your wrist. I own several of these watches. Like the large buttons and they are easily pushed. No loose or shaky parts. This is a solid watch and lightweight. The bold round face with thick protective plastic looks like it could take a fall at great distance or hard hit easily. The screen looks thick as well. Doesn't look like it would be scratch resistant but for the price this is not an issue. I left the protective plastic on for extra protection. The buckle on the strap is large is easily used. I've tried smartwatches and I find I like these watches better. Was a bit hesitant on buying but very happy I chose too. Dont use these for swimming but they definitely are water resistant. I would like to buy one of these in all red and all white. If there was a red and black camo option I would buy that as well. This is a very solid well fitting watch.",
