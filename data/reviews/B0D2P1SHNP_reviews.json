It has many features and everything seems to work great. For me health-related features were most important - heart rate, oxygen meter, and sleep pattern; also exercise and a pedometer are all great features to have.It also has many other features - a stopwatch, timer, alarm, message notifications, and music player; you can make a call (haven't figured out if I can receive calls on it yet). It pairs with your phone and you can see and control some features from the phone app too.Battery life is great - probably going to last 4-5 days on full charge with regular use.",

Something that tells time and can be charged without the constant need for replacement watch batteries. With that goal in mind, this watch mostly delivers, though a few things need tweaking. All are firmware-related. Firstly, if you have the watch set to turn on when you raise it and it's working for you, congratulations, because mine doesn't. The software requires a widget (component) to the right of the main watch face screen. You have to pick at least one and it can't be deleted. Why? There was no airplane mode I could find. The settings are pretty limited. Being able to import your own image (companion app only) is a nice feature, but your custom faces aren't saved in the app. Not even one at a time. Zero. It sends the image to your watch via Bluetooth and that's it. I don't want or need the heart rate feature, but if you're setting your own background, you have to have the heart icon in the upper right corner. It can't be removed, even if you turn off the monitor in settings. On the plus side, the watch is comfortable and lightweight, and if you get it on sale as I did for 30 bucks, it's well worth that amount, but the settings need more features. The companion app as well is fairly barebones.",

This watch has everything I\u2019ve wanted! I\u2019ve had 2 smartwatches in the past (few years) and this is by far my favorite! The size I guess is like a normal smart watch, charging speed is great, it looks exactly like an expensive smartwatch, it tracks my sleep (which that\u2019s one of the reasons I chose it), it is SO easy to set up, you can make phone calls!!! The sound quality is great (for being a watch!), I did a whole call from there, the best part and crazy part that it was a zoom call, and my watch took over when my AirPods stopped working (I mention that because my phone doesn\u2019t work for calls), what else? Text messages! You can read them through your phone (or calls) if you don\u2019t have your phone near you, just answer the call through your watch :) I love it!",

My only complaint was that the instructions were soooo tiny even with magnifiers I couldn\u2019t read them. But I played around with the watch and found the settings and easily downloaded the app and paired it with my phone effortlessly. I have big thick wrists and the band fits me perfectly.

I really like the watch face that shows your steps although there are other many other watch faces through the app to choose from. It feels lighter than an Apple Watch and the size of the face is comparable to the larger Apple Watches. The band is a true watch band with quite a bit of adjustment.You can raise to wake the watch or press the dial which I like because I always seem to bump my other watch and start a workout or timer inadvertently.If you want a simple smart watch without all the bloated apps or features, this is definitely a great choice for the price.",

I have trouble sleeping often so it\u2019s great to see where I truly stand. I am also an active person so the step count is nice as well.

The sleep tracking is very interesting, not sure how accurate because I am asleep! , I do wish it came with a smaller face, I have very small wrists and find this watch face to be a little too big for me however not big enough to make me not wear it but the size of it is hard for me to wear while sleeping so I probably won\u2019t continue to do that.

                        "content": "This watch promises more than it delivers. It purports to measure your pulse, but I find it seriously inaccurate. The values are all over the place, from 50 BPM to over 130 BPM. There is no way I could have been at 130 BPM without my knowing it - I'd have been gasping for breath. I doubt my pulse ever gets down to 50 BPM, either. I'm just not that laid back.The manufacturer says that for greater accuracy you need to wear the watch more tightly om your wrist. When I tried that I found that my skin couldn't breathe, which caused it to become irritated. So the values are just going to be inaccurate.It doesn't seem to know when I go to sleep, either. Often before I turn in, I read for a bit. At such times I am immobile, so the watch thinks I'm sleeping. If I have to get up to pee in the night, the watch thinks I've gotten up for 20-40 minutes or so.It purports to measure blood oxygen saturation levels, which for all I know it might be doing. I have never found any use for that particular function.It annoyingly is connected to my phone such that when I get a call, my watch starts making a lot of noise. I have not yet found the way to stop this. The instructions are inadequate. This is highly annoying, because almost every call is spam.One feature that seems to work well is its keeping track of my steps. That's useful, and is a reminder to me to keep walking. Once upon a time I had a pedometer that I used. That's all it did - measure my steps. I wanted that. So if this watch did nothing more, I would still like it as a pedometer.Overall I am disappointed in this watch. I probably wouldn't buy it again. I might recommend it to someone I didn't like.",
