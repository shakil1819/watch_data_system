The battery life for my GPS use pattern is good, several days. The \u201calways on\u201d but dimmed out Display mode works great. The GPS accuracy is better than the Garmin MARQ I was wearing before. The wrist based HRM is better than the MARQ too, none of the annoying, wildly inaccurate heart rate spikes. The golf app works great and only consumes 15% of a full charge for a 4 hour round. I really like the white band & case and titanium bezel, looks sophisticated and cool. The selection of watch faces is large and I use an Omega Seamaster look-alike. I\u2019ve had pretty good luck with the Amazon Prime music app and the Bluetooth connection from the watch to by Bose ear buds is very good.It\u2019s hard to find cons, I\u2019m disappointed they continue to use the Fenix style connector, the spring loaded connector for the MARQ was MUCH BETTER.I haven\u2019t been able to make Garmin\u2019s external display feature to my Edge 520+ bike computer work, generally, my Edge just crashes. Probably a problem with the edge, not the watch.",

This was an upgrade from a Forerunner 255 and honestly have to say that it kind of measures the same things as the forerunner 255 its just like a luxury upgrade. It has some added features like traning readiness, endurance score and some other which might be helpfull for athletes working with data but they are not necesarily for a amateur athlete. It has a more outdoor activities so i would say its a luxury adventure/outdoor sport watch. Got the white titanium version and looks pretty decent. The only \"not so great\" thing may be the watch bisel which is kind of a grey material that will scratch if smashed against something in comparison to my previously forerunner wich has like a \"plastic\" kind of bisel that doesnt reveals too much of the scratches. But besides that, I believe its a great watch only if you really got the budget to buy it, otherwise i would recommend looking for other options depending on the sports you are doing.",

My other 2 Garmin watches (3HR and 6) were great for tracking activity, but were really only usable in sunlight (outdoors). They were just too dark indoors, even with the backlight. The Epix has all the same functions as the 6 and 7 but with the OLED screen, you can use it anywhere and always quickly and easily read the screen. It was an expensive upgrade since I had bought the 6 only the year before but the screen held me back from using it for indoor exercise. The battery in the Epix is almost as good, lasting around 5 or more days, not quite as good as the Felix 6 but the charging plug is the same and it\u2019s much better than an Apple Watch.",

I have had no issues with pairing to my phone, nor to other garmin sensors. I have used it to broadcast my heart rate to my cyclo-computer when I forgot the strap, and it worked well. I started training using the suggested workout feature and so far I like it. The strap could be a bit longer for people with big wrists, unfortunately there is not real aftermarket option if you need a longer band so make sure it will fit you. Garmin offers diving bands which could be cut to fit, but that is not a great solution either.",

I had quickly realized that the Garman was the absolute best fit for me when it came to my work out tracking and smart, watch features that I valued. However, after being used to the quality of screens coming from my Apple Watch, there was a bit to be desired. I initially started searching for the new forerunner 965 when I decided to take a look at the epic 2. The OLED screen was a key feature, and I would not have upgraded without that. That all being said, the epic two is absolutely living up to its name. This watch really has everything you could possibly need for everything other than diving. I feel the sleep tracking is slightly better with the epic than the forerunner. I also really love the training readiness and tracking more on the epic. The screen itself is absolutely gorgeous and function exactly how you would want it to. The dual GPS capabilities have shown marked improvement on the forerunner as well without a huge battery draw. Speaking of battery, when the watch is not on, always on mode, I have seen consistently around 12 to 13 days battery life before I need to charge. I have actually left on a weeklong vacation without my charger ran multiple times using GPS about 20 to 25 miles during the week and still came home with about four days worth of battery life.",

A gadget you think you need, but we got lost many times navigating in the alps. Now 20 years later I tried the Epix. Nothing has changed, it is the same technology. The main issues are: it is so slow, too slow for mountain biking, not accurate enough, (still) loosing track and simply go in battery save mode during a navigation. Pulling out my iPhone with the trailfork app and it shows exactly position even on airplane mode meaning the Garmin still doesn't use available technology. I talked to many Garmin owner and all they do it tracking their training on a loop they are running every day. For that I don't need a $700 piece. Garmin basically invented the street navigation years ago, but in cities with bike mode on the Epix sends you constantly against one way streets which is quiet dangerous. Then you need the dynamic routing, but the recalculating takes more time on the EPIX than the Garmin 20 years ago. On top you need 5 Garmin apps to cover all functionality. This is prehistoric and so disappointing.Good news: At least amazon refunded although return window was closed due to traveling.",

I watched a ton of video reviews, watch comparisons etc... eventually I pulled the trigger on the white Epix gen 2 and I have no regrets. Not surprisingly 5yrs make a huge difference in watch tech!The display on the Epix is stunning, the touch screen is a joy, the watch is noticeably lighter, and the watch strap seems a lot more durable, apps load fast, sensors are improved, GPS syncs quickly, and the battery life is stunning (with normal GPS activities, and esp if you tweak the display - ~2 weeks with batter saver).Yes this was still an expensive upgrade - did I need to do it? no; am I glad I did? absolutely!",

A lot the stuff that was on my vivoactive 3 was a bit gimmicky, however the same features on the epix seem to work smoothly. For instance rep counting on the epix seems to be spot on. The screen is very bright, the maps are great, navigation works flawlessly, I no longer need to take my brick of a phone with me for workouts.I love that you can store music on the watch itself. Did not use Amazon or Spotify so I just uploaded music I already had purchased. My galaxy buds did not connect well to the watch but it seems the galaxy buds were the issue as the watch works flawlessly with my wireless Sony head phones.There are loads of other positive things about the watch and overall I think it was a great purchase",

See dcrainmaker for a comprehensive review of this watch and its features. Garmin\u2019s user forum is also a good place to get questions and issues solved.

This was incredibly frustrating, especially since the Prime Day discount is no longer available.I\u2019m extremely disappointed, not just with the defective product, but also with the lack of support from customer service.
