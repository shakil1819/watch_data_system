                        "content": "I\u2019ve owned Garmins before and find the ability to objectively gauge and plan your training is a powerful tool. This watch takes it to the next level compared to my old ones. You get essentially the Forerunner 265 here minus the Amoled screen and the training readiness metric. Here\u2019s a hint, look at your body battery and recovery metric and you have pretty much training readiness nailed down. The biometric sensors of the 255 and 265 are the same.Activity tracking is light years beyond Fitbit and also stock Apple Watched. Hell, having 5 buttons blows any Apple Watch out of the water for running. You can just hit an activity and go, or take a recommended workout. You can also make your own routines and upload to to the watch. I had some workouts from when I last owned a Garmin that I designed 10 years ago, and was able to upload and run them. I principally use it for running and strength training. For running I can\u2019t find any faults for me. For strength training my complaint is the list of strength exercises is missing common exercises, like any read deltoid exercises\u2026. It has an exhaustive list of odd ones too. Worst of all, you can\u2019t make new ones. You can just use an existing one that is close enough and make a note that exercise X is really the one you did\u2026. The watch also does a good job tracking indoor runs and both indoor and outdoor walks. It is pretty accurate in automatically detecting activities like impromptu walks, as well. The MIPs screen is amazing outdoors and way better at night when you would don\u2019t want to blast your face looking at the time. In mixed-level indoor lighting, it lacks compared to AMOLED. It doesn\u2019t have the pretty colors nor the contrast indoors, but I like a more serious looking watch anyway and find AMOLED to look like a game. The battery life is amazing. To get this sort of life on the 265 you have to let face go dark when inactive and use gestures to wake it. Not a big deal, but nice to be able to see the watch with a side glimpse without having to raise hand all the time.Customization is great. I downloaded a watch face that allows me to put all the metrics I need and have the time highly visible. Data screens are also very customizable. I have downloaded a custom data screen for running and for strength training to supplement the default screens.This isn\u2019t a Pixel watch or an Apple Watch. As a smart watch it has limited ability and that\u2019s fine. It reliably shows notifications. If you have your phone with you, you can initiate contact with an emergency contact. For example, you can send a message to come get picked up. If you have a compatible bank or credit card, you can use Garmin pay. I do find my financial institutions don\u2019t currently support it, though.The music functionality is flawless. I use it with Spotify and a pair of JBL earbuds. It\u2019s nice to be able to run with just the watch and earbuds and not have to carry a phone for music.I was able to use my ANT heart rate strap and foot pod from 13 years ago with no issues. They sync quickly and stay synced. The onboard wrist heart rate and running dynamics functionality have been very good when I haven\u2019t used my ANT accessories. So there is no need to get an HR strap, but if you have or want one, they work flawlessly.The Garmin ecosystem; the watch, Garmin Connect App, and the website are great. Highly customizable and reliable. I had most recently used Fitbit and found the experience with the app and its website to be headed in a negative direction this last year.Overall, I highly recommend this watch. If the price difference between this and the 265 is around $50, it\u2019s a hard decision. It boils down to how you feel about AMOLED versus MIPS, and maybe the chance that 265 feature set continues to get updated a bit longer than the 255. When the price delta is above $50\u2026. The 265 becomes hard to justify and the 255 is the obvious choice. To reiterate, training readiness isn\u2019t worth much at all. It\u2019s a combination of other metrics that are already on both watches. So the decision is simply AMOLED vs MIPS display versus price.",

What's snowing about 'music' feature: this watch is not able to create playlist from uploaded songs, navigation has only forward button (you have to click to get into menu every time you want to go back), can't set autovolume (songs are played with different loudness), doesn't have option to block buttons on BT headphones. Does not feel like some premium sport smart watch - rather cheap plastic toy but it's light which is a +. It has nice feats like suggested workouts. Battery holds well (longer than Fenix 5), you can easily listen whole day to music (bt headphones will die first). Garmin pay is very limited what cards you can use it with. Live tracking works only when connected with phone.",

The updates from the garmin forerunner 245 are noticeable and the technology in this watch is outstanding. There are plenty of apps to connect the watch to, whether it's running to tennis it has a mode for it. The watch is light and responsive with every button pressed. The GPS signal is strong and accurate and the wrist HR is dead on. I'm going to be honest, I'll never get a garmin with out a music mode to it. It's super clutch to run around with Spotify Playlist loaded on my watch without my phone being needed. Additionally, if you do carry your phone while completing an activity and you happen to fall, there is an incident detection and will contact a designated person on your liat with accurate gps coordinates to you location.This watch is amazing and does everything you need it to do, and more !",

The watch has one major issue which is the connectivity to headphones are not rock solid. This is something Garmin has to address. I had similar issues with my Venu as well. Changed headphones but experience the same problems of music sticking on occasion (sometimes frequently).",

I'll always miss some things like the fun animations (which I'll never get on the Garmin), or the 2-week calendar on the watch face (which might be possible on the Garmin but I can't figure that out). I don't really need to know my blood oxygen level, or track my runs down to the second, or get a nightly sleep score and a daily morning report, but this watch does all those things.It doesn't look as nice as my pebble, but the screen is bigger. It also doesn't have a microphone, the most underrated feature. Actually, that would be Timeline.Anyway, I miss you, PTS, and don't lose hope. Maybe I'll have it in me some day to replace your battery. Please forgive me.",

I was able to get this Garmin 255 Music on clearance otherwise I probably would have gone with a newer Coros. Hopefully I don't have the same button issue, only time will tell.

Music can be transferred from your PC but you have to download a Garmin App onto your PC and, virtually none of your iTunes music will work because it's protected. I was only able to transfer 6 of my many hundred purchased iTunes songs. Audible books can't be transferred at all. Display is too small and too dim to read in most indoor settings. To use a map and to see the route you took, requires downloading a third party app - good luck figuring that one out. The best thing I can say is that the watch collects a lot of great data and stats which you can easily view on your phone. The battery life is the only reason I purchased this instead of an iWatch.",

Still learning how to get the best out of it, but it seems to always have available what I want to try today. In normal operations I am getting 4 to 5 days of battery life. There is minimalist power saving mode that advertises about a month of power. My Moto was good for three hours, my Polar lasted a day, this is great.",

I purchased the watch in March 2024 and also bought Asurion insurance. However, in August 2024, the watch stopped working while I was swimming in the ocean. It simply turned off, and when I managed to turn it back on, the screen displayed colored lines.Asurion couldn\u2019t replace the watch because it was still under Garmin\u2019s warranty, leaving me to deal with Garmin directly. I preferred Asurion\u2019s service, as they would have provided a replacement within two days. Garmin\u2019s process has been slow; I\u2019m currently in my second week without a watch and expect to receive a replacement in another week. Being without my workout tracker for three weeks is unacceptable to me. I took good care of the watch, and it had no damage. I\u2019m disappointed to have spent $400 on something that lasted only five months. I am giving it only one star as I see in the reviews this is common with these watched.",

Simplemente lo tenia conectado al movil para tener las notificaciones... Lamentablemente se drenaba un 30% de la bateria de golpe, lo comprob\u00e9 3 veces cargandolo y usandolo de esta forma por 3 semanas m\u00e1s y me pasaba lo mismo... Debe ser que ven\u00eda con alguna falla el reloj, sin embargo, pude devolverlo sin ningun problema... Sin dudas alguna volveria a comprar un Garmin fuera de este inconveniente, me encant\u00f3 el sofware para deportes! (Dejando de lado el inconveniente con la bateria)",

Also it seems I have been doing a lot of stair climbing, the watch keeps giving me 10 flights sometimes before I get out of bed. I have heard other people who had this problem. I had a forerunner 245 for 3 years and never had these problems. The battery life is erratic, sometimes lasts sometimes dies. I would say I average maybe 5, 10 flights a day. I walk into my kitchen in the morning all on one level and the watch says 10 floors. It pisses me off I cannot see battery duration.Spoke with Garmin they added a log to my watch, I also took some third party apps off so far battery has been better, I will see it has been like this before.",

The other 4 buttons are smooth, so this is obviously a defect. Hope Garmin can improve the quality in the future. I can't tolerate it but I like the watch. So I'm getting a replacement and see if I get lucky.--- edit ---Got another watch this time it's the back button that has this strange click feel. I decided to keep the watch. Battery goes down about 5% every hour if you turn on GPS tracking. So 20 hours for a full charge. I don't use music because it's a battery drainer. Charging is quick. I didn't count exact time but it's around 30 minutes charge to full from 20%.",

You can set the watch to MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) mode by holding the UP button, select System, then USB Mode set to MTP. You can then connect to any computer with the included USB cable and then drag-and-drop MP3 files onto the device (this should work on any OS; I have tested on Windows and Linux, and it should also work on Mac).",
