                        "content": "Though this watch is small and cheap, it gets the job done and looks good doing it. I've had this watch for about 6 months and in that time, it's become about 30 seconds slow - not bad for $16. I've also worn it in the rain countless times, and even in the shower on occasion, all with no issues. My only real complaint with this watch is that the plastic \"crystal\" is prone to scratching.Earlier today, I looked down to discover that the watch no longer worked and the crystal was completely cracked - definitely my fault. If this was any other watch, I'd be upset, but thanks to its ultra-low price, I just bought another one.Bottom line: if you're okay with wearing a very small watch, I can't recommend this one more. It'll survive almost anything you throw at it, and even if you do manage to break it, it costs as much as one meal at Chipotle.",

As anyone else would do, I was enjoying a nice iced tea to combat the fires of hell lingering outside my doorstep, when I began to get tired. Taking off my Casio Men\u2019s MQ24-E Black wristwatch, I tossed it on my bed and it lay there teetering between the edges and the floor, perhaps teasing me at the back and forth idea of its inevitable action, resulting in contrasting outcomes.I payed little attention to it as my eyes drew heavy, I withdrew the remnants of my energy keeping my body moving, and fell onto the bed with an eloquent thud, and it is in this thud where tragedy strikes.My watch, my dear watch, paying no heed, took the leap of faith and into my iced tea that remained on the floor below it, unbeknownst to myself.There, he stayed for 17 hours (I did not know until I got home from work the following day)Distraught, I pulled it out and quickly grabbed a napkin. My heart pacing and knees weak, I began to preach to a higher power to take me instead and not my beloved watch, and soon it followed with anger at how this could happen, how any benevolent being of great divine intelligence and will that transcends the boundaries of contemporary life could allow this to happen.*tick*This faint sound caught my ear,*tick*Yes...Yes! This faint sound was none other than the watch itself! Still clinging onto dear life after facing a sure death.I checked the time on the watch, 6:11 it read.The only true test to determine if my watch fought his battle and won and not regressed into a decaying husk of false temporal information, was to look at my phone clock and see it is matched.Those few seconds it took to look, were the most sweat filled, nausea inducing, heart pounding seconds I have ever experienced. My life flashed before my eyes. I saw my child self walk past me, and it made me long for the innocence that time takes away from us, and this angered me, however,It is the time that gives our lives meaning, it heeds for no thing, no man or woman, no good or bad, time marches on.With this newfound realization, I knew that if this watch did not work, it was okay, I knew that my lost innocence too was okay.Nothing is permanent, nothing is meant to last forever, but the simple fact it existed and meant something to me is what matters.I opened my eyes, and both the phone and watch read 6:11.Best 12 bucks I have spent.",

When I opened the box, the size did shock me & my family, however. So I am documenting that here. I don't mind the size, but I would have liked for the description to plainly point out that this watch's face is a bit smaller than traditional men's watches of this day.It keeps time. It keeps time really well. & I really like the simplicity of the face. I like the gold hands and the gold increments, they go well over black. The watch says \"CASIO\" with \"QUARTZ\" underneath, on the face. In small print under the center radius of the hands is \"Water Resist\" Which I will say, is very true. I do not take this watch off when I take a bath. I submerge it completely in the tub, up to 3 times a day! It has NO condensation under the glass/crystal, and it has NOT lost track of time. It's a tough little watch. Sizing increment holes were great. I think the band is a bit cheap looking but in a millennial classic kind of way lol. I cannot hear ticking unless i have the case next to my ear. I cannot even hear ticking in the dead of night with the watch on.I noticed a small scratch on the glass/crystal earlier today. I assume that was from accidentally hitting the wood frame of the bathroom door this morning. If wood is scratching this model's glass/crystal face, I would have to assume this model's glass/crystal face scratches easily. I'm sure a little tooth paste will buff the scratch right out, especially if it's acrylic.I would recommend this watch to anyone looking for an everyday watch, whom does not mind a small size. may be prone to scratches. If you can't stand to lose 10 bucks, don't submerge this one, as I've heard it is only rated for splash. I've read some reviewers complain that theirs got water inside after submerging. Mine personally does not have any problem with being submerged. (yet!) it's been great for baths.",

I didn't have any expectations about this watch, all I wanted was the cheapest water resistant black watch with gold hands and gold markers (dashes/lines). At this price I expected the dial design to be printed on but I really thought they would put more effort into making it look decent. This is the least reflective gold ink they could have used for the markers. I understand it is a black watch but all my other watches I can easily read in a dark room. I gladly would have paid the extra 50 cents or so it would have cost them to make the markers more shiny.However, since this is pretty much the cheapest watch they offer I can't complain much. When I accidentally splash it while washing my hands it still works, the time is accurate, it's comfortable enough, and it still works after almost one year owning it.They make plenty of leather and nylon bands in this size too so you can replace the nasty plastic band if you want. I just wanted a small watch I can wear every day and not worry about damaging it and this fits the bill perfectly.",

                        "content": "First of all, everyone should get Amazon Prime, because $11.35 for this Casio watch is an absolute deal, especially with the free 2-day shipping. You cannot find any inexpensive, but quality-appearance watch anywhere else, even in retail and department stores.With that said, when the Casio packaging arrived, I was actually expecting a watch that was a bit more strong in the frame and strap, but that was not the case. The wrist strap is flimsy, and the clock frame glass could easily be damaged if the owner does not take good care of it.Appearance: WOW! It looks like a high-quality watch, with the black frame, gold hands and roman numerals. It just looks great. From afar, one would probably think it's a fairly expensive watch. However, if worn casually like on a sunny day, the wrist strap does take away a considerable amount of glamor away from the watch. The wrist strap is the biggest concern for me, but it will not for most people.Comfort: This is a fairly comfortable watch for its prize, but if worn for a long period of time, it can get comfortable and leave red marks on your wrist, but that is expected. Overall, a comfortable watch.Price: Again, you can't beat this price anywhere, especially since Casio is an established, proven watch company. $11.35? That will definitely not hurt your wallet.",

Sweat doesn't collect on it, unlike some metal watches. Not a huge watch face, so I can bend my wrist without the pin jamming into my hand.Not a performance watch - if you want something to use when backpacking, for sports, on the job site, etc. I'd probably get a different one. Minimalist face might require a bit more mental effort to read if you're not used to analog, and there is no night light.Just a great everyday watch.",

THIS IS THAT WATCH. I even wore this watch with a black tie and suit, and it looked like it belonged. My thought process for buying: There are several watches that are even cheaper than this and do more, but all of the watches below this price seem to have considerable quality and reliability issues. By spending $10-$15 on a focused simple time watch, you can more greatly ensure that it is well-constructed. The time is easy to read. The golden marks are shiny enough that you can interpret the time even in dim light. LOOK OUT though. The face is plastic. I've gotten some scratches that are visible at certain angles. This is the only watch I've ever owned that is lightweight enough and low-profile enough for me to want to sleep with it on. The funny thing is though: there's no light on it, so if I wake up in the night, I can't really check the time.It's really impossible to go completely wrong with this watch. Cons: No date or day, no glowing light, plastic face scratches.That's just what you get for such a bargain price. Even if you decide you don't love the watch, it only set you back a little bit.",

If functionality is still maintained, that is even better. This watch blends functionality and aesthetics perfectly.People will often remark on how good it looks, and believe it costs 10 times more than what it is. They even all think that the plastic face casing is glass.But although it is functionally and aesthetically sublime, the materials of which it is made of are questionable. The plastic face scratches quite easily, and the rubber/silicone wristband just begs to be switched to leather to finish off the clean look of the main part of the watch.If this watch only had a glass face casing, a calm, slim leather wristband, and made it easy to replace batteries... I would pass this watch down for generations. I would buy it even if it cost $100, $200. Reasonably, though, if they made the following adjustments and set the price at about $30, it would be the best selling watch on Amazon, especially if they made different colors besides gold/black and white/black.Please, Casio, if you really want a lot of money, do the following adjustments and I will buy around 2-3 of these, and buy more to give away as gifts. I am sure others will as well.As a last remark, in dark light, the metallic hour and minute hands highly reflect low light and are easily seen. The marks for which hour it is, though, are harder to see because they aren't metallic. Every part of the watch should be switched to metallic, or glow-in-the-dark for the hour marks.",

(Also, I'm constantly late, so I want to know HOW late I am...)Although this is listed as a Men's watch, it is small and easily works for a women's wrist. (I have average sized wrists, at 5'9\" - not too big or small). The price point is great, and I love that it isn't flashy - the matte band and casing make it super low key. I own other fancier watches that I simply can't wear because they interfere with typing, the low profile of this watch makes it a go-to for every day.Waterproof? I don't take it off when washing dishes, and I did drop it in the tub for one second once - it held up! Though generally I wouldn't shower or bathe with it on.Pros:Totally inexpensiveLooks goodTells the time accuratelyLow profile - comfortable to wearCons:The plastic bezel will scratch eventually - however at this price point I would just replace it.The only real negative - these seem to be off-market or recalls? The watch came with the battery already engaged. Again, for $11 no big whoop.Buy it.",

It will probably cost you more money to replace the battery than to just buy a new watch. The plastic face gets scratched very easily.It's water resistant. You don't have to worry about damaging it because it's cheap and durable and in a worst case scenario the cost of buying a new one is probably cheaper than the cost of the sales tax of the one you were looking at before you came here. The gold tone hands reflect light and allow for great night viewing without resorting to glow in the dark hands or backlighting. It has hour, minute, and second hands with hour and minute/second demarcations on the face. There is very minimal branding and there are no numerals. It keeps time perfectly. It is everything you need and nothing you don't.I love this watch. I have kept my eyes open for a long time, trying to find one that's just a little bit larger, just a little bit heavier, just a little bit more comfortable, but still keeping the minimalist aesthetic, the excellent value for the dollar, and the complete lack of show-offishness. I still haven't found one.Oh and this thing is completely silent too.",

In other words, I wanted something that could pretty much go with many different styles, but still be able to draw attention no matter what I am wearing. Then, I came across this watch.This Casio watch is advertised as a men\u2019s watch, however, I believe both men and women can rock this watch. Admittedly, I was a little hesitant when first purchasing this product because of the low-cost, however, the simple and sleek design won me over in the end. As stated before, this watch is very simple, but it has a classy edge to it with it\u2019s all black color and golden accents.Pros:~Simple design~Goes with almost any outfitCons:~The band of the watch feels cheap~A sort of snug fit on my wrist~The face of the watch seems a little smaller than expected.I would definitely recommend this product to someone who needs a versatile and cheap, everyday watch. I would not recommend this to someone who is trying to invest in a nice high-end watch that will last for years to come. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.",

This watch looks like, (a) you don't care what other people think of your watch, and (b) you know what watch looks good. It works as a dress watch and you can go totally casual without taking it off, because nobody's gonna think you're a stuffed up peacock with this on. At the same time, they won't think you're a plebe for wearing a $100-$400 quartz watch.Give it a try... it's only $10, and then you can go higher if you need to.Of the MQ24's I'd say this is the best one, followed by the MQ24-7B and the MQ24-1BLK. The white dial versions don't do as well in short sleeves, in my opinion. The other MQ24's don't look tasteful at all.Also consider the MW-59, which is a bit larger with a date.A practical note: I originally got a MQ24-1B a decade ago because my backpack kept getting caught on a bigger watch when taking it off. It was thin enough to avoid that problem. And likewise, the MQ24 today is still thin enough to slip under any sleeve.",

This is true; make no mistake. And you may think, what self-respecting adult would ever wear something like this? I get that, truly. And again, the watch is fairly small (hence the 4 instead of 5 stars). But if you can get over the size of the watch (and I cannot stress this enough, this watch is TINY) it really, truly is a minimalist masterpiece. As a matter of fact, with each passing day, I can begin to see how a smaller-sized watch like this could enhance the appeal of something as minimal in design as this timepiece. It is black with gold accents and that's it, pretty much. No Indiglo. No Sapphire Crystal. No chronometer. Just simple, to-the-point, cheap and efficient and elegant. There really isn't much else say.NB: Pictures of this product are, in my opinion, very important, as it really can come as something of a surprise (the size of this watch) to some people if they are uninformed.

Got it in May 2012 and it conked out late Dec 2012.So that is 6-7 months life on one battery. I was going to buy a new one since I figure the battery is liable to be more expensive than just getting a new watch.I am used to watches lasting years on one battery. Probably because this is nice and lightweight it probably also has a nice and lightweight and unfortunately also low-lifespan battery.I may try to spend a bit more and get a watch that runs longer on its original batteries.------Note: Of the two watches I got of this model at about the same time, the battery went dead on one in about half a year but the other is still running after about 15 months. I conclude that there must have been something faulty about that one. So this watch does not seem to have an inherent problem with low battery life as I previously believed.

                        "content": "I now have several of these fine, inexpensive watches simply because I fear the day that Casio will realize that it's too great a bargain and withdraw it. Beyond the fact that it keeps excellent time, there are some more subtle virtues. It doesn't look expensive or cheap. It's looks black and discretely sophisticated. It goes with anything including, I'm told, I've never tried it, a shower or a swimming pool and, if it does and things don't work out, at the price offered you can easily, quickly (It's on the Prime list so there's no cost in shipping and it arrives promptly in a couple of days...) and no one knows-or probably care-that you've had to replace a watch. (A friend suffered the embarrassment of having to take a \"used\" smart phone to the repair place. So far so good. They had questions about certain \"substances\" that were found in it which was when it was revealed that it was recovered by a plumber from a clogged toilet.It's reliable, comfortable and the only slight negative is that if it's very hot, your wrist might sweat a bit. Of course, if it's that hot, other places will also be sweating and who will care about a sweaty wrist? AND if you're paranoid about sweaty wrists, at the price you can easily have a spare that is dry and ready to roll. An excellent purchase which I've had for several years. And worth every month of it.",

First glance at it, disappointment is the only word to describe how I felt. The watch doesn't look as nice in person as the picture even though it is the right product.I have a feeling that it is not 100% new, because the manual was not placed at the right section and the watch hands were already moving. Generally a new watch would not come as such to prevent the battery from being drained.I may have to give this to hubby early instead and if he doesn't like it as a generic watch to wear around, then I will have to return it.I will update again after getting a closer look at this watch later.Update 1/9/2013:I upgraded from 3 stars to 4 because I gave the watch to hubby last night who seems to like it more than me. When he removed the plastic off of the dial, the watch did become better looking in my opinion. Hubby said it is a cheap watch so he doesn't have to worry about scratching it like his other watches. The band length is good and fits his wrist fine.",

I love the minimalist face, and the lack of bulk - I don't need the whole world to see that I have a WATCH, just something I can put on my wrist and tell time.A few caveats:It's smallish, so if you need to show off your watch, it's not the right one. You should probably get a big gold watch instead.It's analog, and has no numbers, so you need to be able to read a clock without the numbers there for you. And be able to recognize if the writing on the face is upside down, as the current styling doesn't distinguish the 12 from the 6 unlike previous versions.The face scratches; if you go rock-climbing, or work with sand a lot, it will become unreadable eventually.The o-ring seal inside doesn't always go back into place nicely after you've changed the battery; this led to the untimely demise of one of mine. You can get replacement o-rings, but it's a pain.The band is cheap plastic; it will eventually break and you'll need to buy a new band. This will happen far sooner than anything else will go wrong, unless you're very gentle with your watchband.",

Hell, it doesn't even have numbers on the dial. you have to figure that stuff out for yourself. it's made of plastic, because nothing says \"i do not care\" like plastic.black plastic.it costs $10. if you buy a $10 wristwatch you are either so old that you think a high-quality watch should cost less than a low-quality beach-towel, or you do not care about the quality of your watch as long as it tells the time. Even if you get one that doesn't keep good time, it cost you $10. You spent more money on coffee and lunch yesterday.Way more.I bought this watch, and i couldn't be happier with it. I think it's at the bottom of a suitcase in my closet, but I'm sure if i went and looked for it, it would still be keeping perfect time and not caring about any of my other time-related questions.I won't though.",
