The light button is on the right side but otherwise I love it. I\u2019m super impressed with the fit and quality. I tried the discounted returned item and it was perfect. The box was a little banged up and the instructions were missing but for $6 less than regular price I think it was worth it. I\u2019m so glad I found another water resistant watch. Buy it, you\u2019ll love it.",

I almost bought another one because, for $13 (sale price), you get a sturdy, stylish watch that is easy to use and reprogram.The watch is also water-resistant. I wash a lot of dishes lol so it's really nice not to have to fiddle with my watch every time I have to put my hands under water! It's been about 3 weeks since I bought the watch, and it's really helped me at work with managing my time, and I love how many modes this little watch has. It has a spot for a second time zone, an alarm that beeps at you a few times when it goes off, and a stop watch, and if you press the ST/STP (start/stop) button, you'll be able to see the month, day, and year. Super great purchase!",

                        "content": "I purchased this watch in the middle of a summer camp season in 2022 after my 15-year-old Timex sports watch (Yes, 15 years old\u2014so old that the model is no longer made) finally gave up the ghost. With its predecessor having survived everything from water to mud to bicycle crashes, I had high expectations for this one.So far everything is going well. The watch does have a 24 hour mode, which is essential for me, as well as an alarm, water resistance, and an attractive gold-coloured face plate. It has survived everything I have thrown at it so far, from waterskiing to 100-degree heat, to washing dishes in a commercial kitchen. Armitron got all the most important stuff right even in a shrinking market; the reason I did not give this a 5 star review was that this watch does have a few odd quirks that I have detailed belowPros:Excellent priceReasonably stylishSmall, compact and light weightWater resistant (this does not mean fully waterproof; do NOT press the buttons underwater)24 hour time and a serviceable backlightShows no signs of wear even after 4 months heavy use.Cons:Display lacks some contrast compared to my old TimexWhile it allows you to set the year in its date readout, it does not do daylight savings time automatically\u2014somewhat puzzling because I thought that was the point of setting the year.Cannot figure out how to swap the T2 auxiliary time zone into my primary time zoneNo count-down timerWhile the faceplate is gold, the band clip is silver. This is unimportant if you buy a silver one.The lettering on the front that reads \u201cArmitron WR 330M\u201d faded away within 4 days.Not quite as accurate as my old Timex\u2014I lose about 1 minute per month, which is just okUpdate, April 2, 2023: About 8 months later, and still going strong. The plastic watch face is proving to be more scratch resistant than my previous Timex, and I still feel that the watch is presentable outside of work.",

Once I worked my way to wearing it, I loved it from the moment I put it on!!I've really active and have worn a sports watch 24/7 for nearly 25 years. When I dress up for a nice dinner, party or formal occassion, I struggle with finding the right watch that hides the noticeable tan line on my wrist, but still looks classy.For an inexpensive sports watch, this one looks fabulous for a night out in a dress! I've already had two friends notice it, and when I show them what I'm wearing they are shocked at how nice it looks.It's the perfect size and has all of the functions I need in a sports watch. I ordered two more so I have plenty of backups for a long time :)",

It does come with instructions and was very easy to set the time, the date was already showing today\u2019s date. One of the reasons I bought this watch is because of a negative review regarding the watch band, they claimed it was more of a beige color than pink. It definitely is a very light beige or even off white which makes me happy because I don\u2019t like pink. The gold is a rose gold although I suppose it could look different depending on the lighting. The watch band is comfortable and fits my small wrist. Of course I don\u2019t know about the battery issue, time will tell\u2026 I\u2019m quite happy with this watch so far, I\u2019ll update if any issues occur. 21 days later and the battery is still working perfectly.",

It still sorta works. But isn't really readable. The battery is still working fine after 3 years though.I bought a replacement, and it's not as good.

The band is long when tightened to the first notch, but the wristband keeps it in place. It's a little misleading in the sense that when you first see the picture, it looks as if the month is also displayed on the screen. That's not the case. You actually have to press and hold one of the buttons in order to see what month you're in. I bought this watch to help a child with special needs understand how to tell time and learn calendar dates. The fact that you have to go through an extra step in order to view what month you're in kind of defeats part of the purpose. Overall, the silicone on the band seems durable. Comfort-wise, there was one complaint that it was difficult to write while wearing the watch from the child. I didn't see any scratches on it whatsoever. I do find that the modes are little difficult to use, set and remember as there are 4 buttons that do a huge amount of things. This might be confusing for some children.",

I travel a lot, so it will help me. I do have a Garmin, so I bought this specifically because I was going to take an exam for which a stopwatch was recommended but a smart watch was not allowed. In the end, I couldn't use this one because you can't turn off the beeping sound it makes when you hit buttons. That would cause a distraction to the others taking the exam around me.In most situations, I can see why you would want that beeping sound. If you are using it when running, for example, you don't need to look down at your wrist to see if the stopwatch started because the beep sound let you know. But for my needs, I had to be able to turn that sound effect off. So, I do wish that was something you could turn off or on.But the watch looks great. I actually chose the one I bought because it looked like my Garmin. It was really easy to use and I'm sure it will last a long time. I'll probably pack it on my other trips as a back-up watch in case my other one runs out of battery.",

For me, they usually last 2-3 years before either the band breaks or the battery dies. And I wear it constantly and wear it swimming. First problem I have had is with the most recent purchase of it. Ordered it in July of 2024. It arrived with a dead battery. Sure, i could have just replaced the battery, but dang it, i paid for something that should arrive in working order. So, I returned it. But they sent me what looks to me like a used or refurbished one. There is an extra strap holder on the band that is very faded, the band itself is not completely clean, and there was no film covering the face. Again, i paid for a NEW one. So, I tried to start another return and it says they can't replace right now. Great. I guess I should have just stuck with the dead battery one. At least it didn't look previously worn",

Very nice product for the price. I bought this specific watch for the use of the stopwatch feature as my past ones were analog. Unfortunately, the watch has water damage after a casual afternoon floating in the pool. The watch still works, but there was clearly water under the screen and a small part of the day of the week is not working. I have had this watch for 5 months, so I was disappointed by how quickly this one was damaged. Purchased a new one (as they so affordable) and hopefully have no issues with that one!",

The time on this watch is large enough to see without my readers. I wish the strap was a little longer so that the \"tail\" of the strap doesn't pop out of the band, but I have a 7 1/2 inch wrist which is a little larger than some. Other than than, it's a great watch. I got complements on the pretty purple color, too!",
