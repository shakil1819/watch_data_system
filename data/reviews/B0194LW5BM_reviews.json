                        "content": "Just got it in today. Looks and feels great. I will post in the future on any updates. The watch looks and feels very well made. It\u2019s not too heavy, and easily read. The Date window is pretty small. The watch band is very comfortable and seems durable. I absolutely Love the Luminous button, which looks great in low and dark lighting. This watch is the 40mm case size, which is the smallest watch I\u2019ve ever owned. I have always bought much larger watches, i.e. 46mm and larger. So I am still getting used to the smaller watch, but it still is a great size. I\u2019ve done a ton of research, and bought many watches, so this one seemed to have a lot of great reviews. I will update my review, whether good or bad, in the future. Because I know how hard it is to find a good watch, for a decent price nowadays. So far, songood",

The case is a brushed grey, a little lighter than gunmetal. Simple and sleek! Can't remember the last time I had a watch with indiglo - love that! The watch brand seems like a decent quality leather band - it does take time to break in though, which I'd expect will lend to durability long term.Only minor downside is the lume on the hour/min hands is pretty weak. But doesn't seem all that necessary when you have the indiglo lighting up the dial in low light.Time and Date setting was a breeze - pretty standard for anything with a crown.",

                        "content": "Overall it's a very decent watch and I am satisfied with it, considering the price (I bought it on sale for around $45). I'm a little surprised that even my wife has mentioned a couple of times that it's a nice looking watch. Don't get me wrong, no one will mistake it for a $300 watch but I like how it looks and that's good enough for me. I wanted an inexpensive daily watch with Arabic numerals, easy to read and not too cluttered, with a little bit of field watch look and this watch met the need. For comparison's sake, the other option I was considering was a Seiko 5 field type watch, which would be fine but also at least 3 times more expensive and I didn't want another Japanese watch, I already have a Citizen Promaster so I'm good on that score and I didn't feel like coughing up a few hundred bucks for a Swiss automatic movement. I'll list my pros and cons and make it short:Pros:- good looking face, large Arabic numerals- size is about right for my personal taste, I don't like larger diameter watches but some people do- light weight was moderately important to me- accuracy, telling the time accurately is a watch's reason for being, and I think this is plenty accurate, about the same my Citizen Promaster or even a little tighter, really, but I'm not such an important person as to worry about a couple of seconds off here and there- solar, so no battery changes to fool around with the Expedition Solar version I purchasedCons: I don't have any strong negative opinions for this watch, particularly considering the price bracket we are in, but I will say- the lume is a little on the weak side, it doesn't last very long in my opinion so it would be hard to read at night or in a dark environment- height, I could wish it were a little thinner, it's not terrible but I just feel it sits a little taller than it has a right toTo sum it up again, it's very decent watch and I would give it 4 and 1/2 stars",

                        "content": "So far, I've bought three Timex watches, two of the expedition series and another fancier 'dress' type.I have a year and two months of usage on one of them, as a 'daily driver' watch, the Expedition Scout, green woven wrist band with a black face.I wear this watch almost exclusively, day and night. At work, in bed, in the shower, everywhere. Rarely does this watch come off my wrist. My day job doesn't keep things nice for long, and seems to test the things I use quite well. I work in manufacturing, as a technician. I move big, hot, blocks of steel and reach into tight, greasy spaces, full of things to knock the face and everywhere else on.Guess what? Still works, still looks pretty good. There's some finish wear, and a couple small chips in the glass, but that's to be expected. It keeps it's time well, and the calendar function works well. There's been a couple of instances where the adjustment knob has gotten pulled out, but otherwise it keeps it's time well. It is absolutely a reliable watch, without question.I recently bought another Expedition Scout, this time with a brown leather strap and a white face, otherwise it's the same watch. I only bought this one for some variety, change things up a bit.I do have two criticisms. One, I really really wish the watch also displayed what day of the week it is, in addition to the numerical date. But that isn't huge.Second, both of these watches have the Indiglo feature, which is nice. However, I immediately noticed something when I got my latest watch. The usability of the indiglo degrades substantially if the face of the watch is dark. The white/almond color face of my new watch lets much more light through.Side note, the dark grey lettering on a black face is a little difficult to read, in contrast to the black letters on the white face of my new watch. Definitely going to stick with white face watches from now on. That said, I never had issues reading the darker watch. I only noticed it upon viewing the new one I bought.In short, buy a timex.",

So, I started researching and researching, reviewing reviews and truly spent lots of time deciding on what the perfect watch to buy would be. I considered expensive, inexpensive, Swiss made, non Swiss made and after deciding to find a solar, best for the money watch I purchased this watch!I researched so many watches at every price point and style. The great reviews, style and price point brought me to TIMEX. I decided as this is my first watch in years so best keep it budget. I was considering the Indiglo Timex as I have always loved to cool glow but I ran across the Solar Timex. To be clear you loose the indiglo option will ALL Solar Timex watches so its a trade off, do you want indiglo or solar power and no battery changes? My research suggest I may get a crazy amount of life out of this watch with the solar power. Im not one to take a watch in to get a battery replaced and as I understand the more you use the indiglo the quicker I would need to change out a battery, Thats a no go for me so SOLAR TIMEX it is!The hands and numbers of this watch will glow after being in light but that glow fades quick, As far as the watch itself , I love the styling. My family loves the look. This watch is a blackish brass with a stainless back and a real lens so its a great watch for the money that I expect will last me years! My fist thought was I wanted a green band watch and may buy a green band one day but the color of this band looks better on me than in the pictures, the color is growing on me. The watch is somewhat larger that I expected on my medium size male wrist but I don't think I would want a smaller watch after a few days of ownership. The date is small for my old eyes but thats not a deal breaker at all.I think this is a very classy sporty everyday looking non fancy watch and solar is the way to go! Who wants to take a watch to a shop to have the battery changed every few years? Im very happy my extensive research made me choose this watch. I'm as happy with this watch as I would be with one of those mega expensive import jobs as this thing looks and feels fantastic! I feel I got way more than I paid for buying this watch.When I was considering expensive I decided with the fact it's been years that I have used a watch I better make sure a watch on my arm won't bother me. I'm happy to report this is a very comfortable watch and I see zero need to spend more as this is the perfect price point of you get a good solar watch and looks good and feels good so I have no real need for anything more premium.With this watch I get a known name brand quartz movement thats solar and based on some reviews I hope to perhaps get 5-10 years or more life out of this watch and solar battery. I needed the stainless steel back and I wanted a leather band.I find I am actually proud of my new watch! Anyone remember the 1950's saying... \u201c TIMEX, It takes a Licking and Keeps on Ticking\u201d",

It ticks SUPER loud for a little watch.I have had this watch for a little over a year and it has seen mostly light and medium duty use. Typically I work construction and have worn Casio G-Shock watches. I had a temporary change in work circumstances and had just worn out my previous Casio so I decided to try something different. I like simple watches and this watch resembled a Timex I had as a kid as my first real watch so I watched a couple reviews on it. They warned of the loud tick, but recommended it because of the price so I ordered one.For what it cost, it has been a good field watch. I wouldn't wear it at my construction job because there is no raised edge to protect the face, but for some mid-grade field use, it has held up pretty well. I've worn it swimming in freshwater several times and it hasn't had any leaks. The finish on the case gets chipped and scratched easily, so don't expect it to stay pretty unless you baby it. The nylon band is comfortable, but suffer the same problem most of them do: over time the hole most commonly used begins to stretch out and get frayed into a larger hole. Thankfully it will be easy to replace and those bands are common.I wish it had the luminous markings like my old watch so I wouldn't need the Indiglo as much, but it is easy to see at night with the light.",

Although I really like it, it is pretty heavy. I also found that I really never used all the multiple features. I therefore searched for another watch that would look really nice and just give me the time and date, the only features that I actually use. I concentrated on finding a Timex watch because of its decades-long reputation, and it's reasonable prices. Timex has so many choices of colors and wrist bands, I ended up spending hours searching and I learned a lot.I noted two complaints. First, that the date feature is very, very small and is hard to read. I agree.it is ridiculously small. After so many complaints about the size of the date feature, I would think Timex would redesign this feature to be equal to other brand watch date sizes. But this alone wasn't a deal breaker for me. Second, I read complaints about the acrylic crystal that covers the face easily scratched. I discovered that on Amazon there are two main Timex listings. One listing has mineral crystals, which are high quality, traditional, and less likely to scratch. And the other listing has choices of watches with acrylic (plastic) crystals. I imagine that the mineral crystals are for watches manufactured before Timex found a way to cut costs and started to primarily use acrylic crystals. Hey, Timex, stop cutting costs and maintain your quality reputation!I also saw a couple of complaints that the second hand ticking was very loud and distracting. My Expedition watch's second hand is completely silent. This person must have purchased a different Timex watch that isn't quartz and uses a battery.My leather band is very comfortable and has several notches to fit almost anyone's wrist size.Finally, I would encourage Timex to expand their selection of solar powered watches. Although they cost more, one never needs to change a battery.Overall, I am very happy with my Timex watch. it's a quality watch with basic features, and you can't beat the price.",

It\u2019s cheap enough to worry about it, and that is what a watch should be, a tool, an item that gains scars over use and shows some character. I\u2019m guilty of trying to keep things in pristine condition and at the end of the day, that\u2019s stupid. My only reason for giving it one star down is the strap is stiff and a little short for my wrist\u2026 but I still use it.",

I wanted another watch for everyday bank-around and casual wear. And I wanted one one with utilitarian flavor. This one fits the bill. I rated it 4-stars becaus the band (for me) is near shameful. It's simply too cheap. When I received the watch, I immediately ordered another Nato strap via Amazon--the color, quality and fit of the new band is marketedly better. I stayed with the Army Green color. Excellent Watch. Peace.",

It's not because the band is in fabric, even though that would not have been my first choice. But the hardware on the band causes scratches on my desk and sticks out so much that it was catching on things. First order of business was to find a different watch strap, thereby adding cost to the cost of the watch. But, for those who like the watch itself for the same reasons I have, it's a good buy.",

                        "content": "There are many articles online about the Timex Scout 40. There are also many video reviews. And there are the many reviews here on Amazon.I'm not sure what I can add to all that. But I'll try.I'll focus on the luminous hour and minute hands, the second hand, and the accuracy. Some of what I'm writing is based on the way I use the watch and some on info I've gathered from the articles and videos I mentioned above.I'll start with the luminous hands since that's why I bought the watch.None of the current watches I wear have luminous hands. Indiglo on the digital Timex and the LED on the digital Casio can light up the whole watch face. They are activated with a simple press of a button, typically a momentary push. But I wanted a watch where the face or at least the hands are continuously illuminated in a dark environment.I've learned through research online that there are different types of lume that can be applied to watch hands and different grades within each type. I'd like one day to get a watch with tritium tubes illuminating the hands. Till then, the luminescent hands on a Timex does the job.I generally have a strong light source on me such as an LED headlamp. I find I can charge up the watch hands in a few moments from that light.The hands glow bright immediately after charging but become progressively dimmer over time. However, the hands are still legible even hours later in a darkened area with dark adapted eyes. That works for me. And if needed, the hands can be quickly recharged with the portable LED light that's always nearby.A number of reviewers have mentioned that their Scout 40 second hand does not align with the dial markers as it jumps in one second intervals. Apparently, this is an issue across watch brands for quartz watches. One reviewer on Amazon said he exchanged his Scout watch because the second hand did not align and the exchange watch's second hand did align.One video said the user can align the second hand if necessary by taking the watch apart and nudging the second hand. I might try that if needed on a future purchase. But as it is the second hand on the watch I received lines up nicely.There is still a parallax issue when the watch is viewed at certain angles. It's to be expected. The second hand sits above the other hands. One way watch designers minimize parallax is by bending the hands towards the watch face. (Although it might be the primary reason for the bending is to conform with the curve of a domed crystal.) But that's a tricky fix, apparently, that is done by hand and not something that is common. In the case of the Timex Scout, it would be overkill.The accuracy of the Timex Scout according to one website is plus or minus 20 seconds per month, although so far I could not find that spec listed anywhere by Timex.Some owners mention that their Scout watches don't seem to be gaining or losing much time at all. I had a Timex Chronograph like that. I think it was off like 2 seconds a month. The cheapest Casio I could find just to have a backup watch is also amazingly accurate.This Timex Scout is within the plus/minus 20 second a month range. I haven't let it run yet for say a week without resetting to get a better idea of the accuracy. I may update this review if and when I get around to better determining the accuracy.",

Essentially, the color of a brand new yellow leather construction boot. I was going to return the watch because it did not match my belt/shoes as the whole plan was to buy something with a brownish strap. A friend suggested applying olive oil to the strap which darkened it up nicely and saved me from having to go to the UPS store to return this back to Amazon. Otherwise, this model works well as is solar powered and I should probably never have to open the back to change a battery during its lifetime.",

The Timex I purchased came with a black leather strap that was OK. There is nothing wrong with the strap that it came with, but it felt a little thin on my wrist. Plus I didn't necessarily want to wear a leather banded watch for my daily tasks. So I purchased a nylon band and I enjoy wearing the watch so much more. Feels nicer and looks nicer with a t-shirt and shorts. The leather band will be kept to swap out for more appropriate occasions.The watch itself is exactly what I was looking for. Simple, easy to read and accurate. Plus the backlight is a nice also. I have other versions of this watch picked out that I will be buying sooner or later. Would recommend",

The black paint IS slightly reflective but not overly so. The band is a military cosplaying olive drab-ish color and is very comfortable. It is secured by what seems to be sturdy black plastic rings and latch. It's been about two-and-a-half months since I received this and the Indiglo lighting still functions as expected. This IS a battery powered watch so there is no winding (I would have preferred a hand wind, but I'm weird... most people will appreciate battery power).As far as inexpensive watches go, this one is ideal for me. It doesn't look cheap at all, instead it accents my pragmatic and utilitarian aesthetic. This customer is very satisfied and this time piece is confidently recommended.",

It has not gotten in my way once and since I keep it on my right wrist, the little dial thingy does not activate the glowing feature when my wrist bends up. I have not tested it in the shower out of fear of the chance of rusting and/or breaking. I have used it while doing dishes and so far nothing, even when a bunch of water was splashed on it.",
