There are no clocks at the workplace and it makes me uncomfortable always looking at my cell phone for the time, via the boss might think that I am playing around on the cellphone. A cheap watch is what I needed just for that purpose. It's fits perfect and I am a middle aged woman. It doesn't cause a rash or redness on the wrist which a cheap one from Walmart did and the one from Walmart stopped working after a week or two. This one seems better quality than that. And it has clear, readable numbers, which is appreciated for a quick glance. We will see how long the battery will last.",

It is on the larger side for a ladies watch, the size of a smaller man's watch, which is what I wanted. I like the trifold clasp, but it is a bit large for my wrist and the links are not removable. For the price I think that part is probably reasonable.But I don't like that the battery is non-replaceable, and that it was already running when I got it. I think the non-replaceable battery should be mentioned in the description, especially when we don't know how much life has already been used in the battery when we receive it.",

It was Amazon Clearance for $17 and change, something so inexpensive so if I lose it on vacation, I won\u2019t cry over it. I did nominal research on Nine West watches as a brand and learned that they are actually known for accuracy and consistency along with silent movement. I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised by this watch. It is silent. It appears to be as accurate and as consistent as my cellphone. I wanted a large watch so that I could glance and see the time. This Nine Weat watch is very large. Large snd pretty. It was a good buy.",
