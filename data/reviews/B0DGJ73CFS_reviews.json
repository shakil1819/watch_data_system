I bought them for a door prize raffle, but they arrive super quickly and new and sealed etc. You gotta watch some places like the big W as one of the Apple watches last year had been used and damaged and somehow placed back in the box and sealed. Never had that happen with Amazon as Amazon is top notch! Thanks, appreciate it. Oh and all accolades aside for Amazon, Apple watches are the bomb, great watches.",

Today the watch wouldn\u2019t allow Apple Pay, and I found many complaints about this at various tech sites.I\u2019m done with this product, not worth the money and certainly not worth the irritation.I\u2019ve owned Apple products since 1977, many of them built well and long lasting.
