This watch is exactly the same as what you would buy in store, but without the wait. I have always liked this Apple Watch because I've never needed the newest one. The functionality, sound quality, Watch quality, and weight were always some of my favorite things about it. I love that this one came with the more cream/rose colored band. But for work I usually just used my old band so I don\u2019t damage the new one. If you want an Apple Watch at a good price and don\u2019t need the newest one, I would suggest this one. I like the price of it a lot better too.",

As a mom of toddler, this is very helpful tool so that I get notification while my phone is inside stroller or diaper bag and chasing my child in the park. I also love the GPS and emergency notification that I can share with my family. I have started to work out little more and care for health as it encourage to stand up, track movement etc which is very helpful. I\u2019m impressed with the battery life and how fast it charges too! I\u2019ve been using iPhone since it came out and MacBook but Apple Watch was something I didn\u2019t think I needed. It\u2019s not something you need, but it is well worth investing to make your life easier. Watch quality and size is perfect for my arm and it is durable and water resistance so I don\u2019t have to worry about it while playing in the splash pad or parks too!",

Went to the Apple store for a free class and discovered that our teacher had the same watch. I don't need all the fancy things a watch can do these days - but at the right price, this is the same price as a Fit Bit and does so much more. My watch doesn't have cellular capability, so the phone has to be within 30-40 feet - but if I'm busy I can answer calls on it! Read messages, emails, keep track of steps, sleep; easily change watch faces to match mood or outfit. And, I can see the time and all writing outside in the sunlight. Great improvement over my last FitBit. Great product.",

It's awesome for my runs and workouts, keeping me on track with my fitness goals. The sleep tracking feature is super helpful, giving me insights into how well I'm actually sleeping. Plus, the reminders to stand up and move around every hour have been great for keeping me active, especially during long stretches at my desk. Overall, the Apple Watch has really become a go-to gadget for both work and staying healthy!",

I usually trend towards LBP, so knowing I\u2019m in a safe range gives me peace of mind. I also like the State of Mind and Mindfulness widgets. I already got other bands to fit my mood and outfits. Great buy!!",

The sports band is not my favorite as it pinches my skin when putting it on, but the color of it is still cute. The screen on the watch is brighter than I expected and the sensitivity of the watch face is lovely. I would recommend getting some sort of screen protector or a case because it does seem that maybe one good drop would crack it all up. But definitely recommended this watch! Not to big too which is what I was worried about.",
