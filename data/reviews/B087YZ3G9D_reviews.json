Black display is sleek and modern, but a bit harder to read, naturally, than the silver ones. But that's my choice -- in this case, fashion over function. Best part of this watch is the 24-hour DUAL TIME display function -- my second time is always set to GMT in 24-hour format, which I use for work every day. It's also extremely comfortable, lightweight, waterproof and tough. I literally wash it gently with soap and water after a long run or bike ride. Five stars overall -- value for money, function and durability. Caveat for the black display only; slightly harder to read.",

                        "content": "I really like this watch. I like the simple and low profile of those old school Casio watches. No pretense, which is my style. As a diver, I wanted one that went down to 100m. So I paid a little extra this time for that feature. The black background and white digits is very unique and gives this watch a sleek look. I think it might be the only one that I've seen with that LCD setup. The only issue I have is when I go swimming it is difficult to nearly impossible to read with googles or masks that are tinted. I can read it well with my clear diving mask when I push the illumination button. But otherwise, I can't read it at all. I have to pull out my diving light which is no big deal. Or in a swimming pool, I will have to surface and remove my goggles to read it. I reckon this will not be a problem for most people, especially if you are purchasing this item based purely on its aesthetics as I basically did. It was too cool to pass up. And I am keeping it. I have the Casio solar power watch that I use instead when going in the water, as a back up to my dive computer. Or when I really need to watch my time in the pool, which is hardly never. I love my tinted and mirrored goggles, but for indoor pool use, I think I'd like a clear set anyhow. Or maybe not, pools at the gym can be disgusting. I also wish the screen was a bit more scratch resistant, but the pool I use in the gym has an almost sandpaper like surface to it, so I just flip my watch to the other side of my wrist to avoid contact with surfaces. I hope they keep this style as when this one dies out, I will definitely buy another one. One thing to look out for with these types of watches. They claim a ten year battery life, but somehow the alarm got activated for midnight everyday. I had to refer to the book to shut it off. It wasn't really a huge problem, but I was worried that it would shorten the battery life. You can apparently replace the battery. Tutorials are available on YT. Having worked on my diving computer, I would probably use some kind of silicone grease on the gasket to ensure water proofing.",

I'm never ashamed to have it on my wrist and it goes with pretty much anything. The blacked out display is sick and I think it elevates the watch a bit (over a typical cheap Casio with a lighter display and colored lettering), I don't worry about it looking corny or cheap.Also, I use the dual time function to see my friend's time in China\u2014not that the perfect 12-hour difference makes for very difficult math.. Cool option, though.The only thing I would change about this watch is the color of its buttons. I think they detract only slightly from the Black Out theme. I'd keep them metallic but maybe go black or gunmetal/charcoal for color.",

Everything works like it should however, I\u2019ve only worn it around the house and I noticed about a million little scuffs on the face, this watch crystal will scratch most easily, just something to keep in mind. I really think Casio would do themselves and the consumer a tremendous favor by putting a real mineral crystal in rather than the soft cheap plastic one. This watch will not last even half of the 10 year battery life it came with without a mineral crystal. I would recommend this watch only because it\u2019s cheap enough to be replaced often. Thanks.",

A couple of issues with this one I instantly noticed is it's too easy to bump into 24hr format and I don't like that the light only stays on for 1 second regardless if you hold the button down. My old one stayed on as long as you held the button. And lastly, the 10 year batt life is fine and I'll never have to worry about it but it's funny that in the manual it states that it's based on only using the lumination once a day. Anyway, I like the watch and glad I got it on sale.",

The display is difficult to read in sunlight or any high light condition, and the \u2018LIGHT\u2019 button doesn\u2019t help\u2014the backlight is too weak to do anything in normal daylight conditions. The backlight is perfect for checking the time in a dark sleeping bag/room/etc. without being too bright, but that makes it essentially useless during the day.Otherwise, it\u2019s a good simple, discreet watch. Most watches have too much information, or not enough, or it\u2019s displayed in a cluttered/confusing manner. This watch excels in the layout and presentation of info. It\u2019s just hard to read in lots of normal lighting conditions.",

However, the small size means it\u2019s comfortable and very lightweight. I also don\u2019t like the band, while it\u2019s plenty long for me, the buckle sits on the outside of my wrist and creates a pressure point which I don\u2019t like and on top of that causes the watch to rotate to the outside, just not a very good band for me, if you have a smaller wrist maybe it would be better but then again the band is so long that may be an issue for some. Then there\u2019s the light, it lights up from the bottom corner and doesn\u2019t illuminate evenly, not a huge issue but it\u2019s much more noticeable in person than any pictures seem to show. Overlooking these gripes, it\u2019s aesthetically pleasing, is generally comfortable, really lightweight and functions well.",

It's been through a lot of abuse and salt water for more than a year and it just has a barely noticeable scratch on the screen. I didn't read the size (37mm) when buying it and thought it was a 40mm, so it's smaller than I expected, but that's on me (read thoroughly next time). The black on black looks great.

Other heavy watches that had step counters, etc. would give him wrist irritation from the sweat build up but this watch has been great - no irritation after several months of wearing it. It's a bit hard to read for me but he has no problem at his age.",
