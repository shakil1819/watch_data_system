And as someone with ADHD, this has been an amazing tool for locating my phone in a pinch.I have to take a lot of medication in a day. I put the information in the health app and set reminders, the watch reminds me until I long the medication. It\u2019s been very helpful, and provides an easy way to record the time my meds were taken. I consistently have panic attacks, and my watch will notify me when my heart rate spikes, giving me enough time to relocate and try to ground myself. The breathe app is also a great grounding tool for me, the haptic feedback is a great thing to focus on when everything else around me gets hard to process. Furthermore, it has made it easier to sleep! I have never completed a 5 min breathing exercise in bed, I always fall asleep before it is done. I just close my eyes and match my breathing with the vibrations, it eases the anxiety and gives my brain something to focus on when winding down. Speaking of the haptic feedback, that combined with the amazing sound coming from this watch has broken my habit of snoozing the alarm and falling back asleep. This watch also tracks my sleep, so I can get an idea of how long I sleep each night!For exercise, it has been nice tracking my steps. I had no idea that I walked up and down 27-30 flights of stairs at work! I knew I moved around a lot, but not that much. It serves as good motivation for recording my exercises at the gym. I now log everything and can create a nicer workout schedule.The battery life is great, and it takes maybe 45 mins to charge. I keep it on when I\u2019m sleeping and charge it when I\u2019m showering before work. It is water resistant, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be comfortable with wearing a watch in the shower. So far there have been no scratches on the display, and I don\u2019t have a screen protector on it. The only thing I don\u2019t like is the wristband. I think it induces sweat that ultimately irritates my skin, so I habitually wipe it down with an alcohol pad. I\u2019m on the lookout for a professional looking band that has nice airflow.",

I really like that.And I like that there\u2019s so many different faces that you can buy you don\u2019t have to stick to one.And I like that it\u2019s constantly monitoring my Heart rate and exercise, how far I walk and it even remind me to stand up and stretch. I need that, it tells me how long I\u2019ve washed my hands And gives me a vibration when I can stop. Crazy isn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t know I like it because I really have a hard time, remembering things.I like the fact that I can change bands whenever I want too.I guess the only thing I really don\u2019t like about it is that I have to plug it in all the time to charge it up lol I\u2019m used to never having to charge a watch. lolAnyway, really nice watch and definitely worth the price.",

                        "content": "The media could not be loaded. I have used many smart watches from Huawei and Xiaomi, but with the iPhone, of course, the Apple Watch is the best. Integration into the ecosystem, ease of use. This watch has it all. A large selection of straps for them, both official and from Aliexpress. In terms of functionality, it is as if you are wearing an iPod on your hand. 64 gigabytes of memory is more than enough. There are a couple of things that do not suit me. 1st - battery. After 24 hours of use (I also sleep in them) there is about 35-50 percent left (depending on how many messages I receive and how often I use the watch). 2nd - automatic transition to sleep mode, that is, its absence. Well, was it really that difficult to make an automatic transition to sleep mode when the watch understands that I fell asleep. Huawei and Xiaomi have this, but Apple Watch does not. And if you do not turn on sleep mode, the watch will not count how much you slept. And the last minus - why can't I play music from the watch speaker? I know this feature was added to the 10th series, but why doesn't it work on the 9th series? This speaker can play music, but this feature is missing. It constantly asks to connect a bluetooth device or plays music from the iPhone speaker. Otherwise, this is a great watch that is definitely worth buying.",

                        "content": "After using a Fitbit versa for 4 years, I was ready to try something new. I did a lot of research and found that the apple watch was good for fitness and health tracking, as well as having lots of extra features that many fitness watches don\u2019t have. Here are my thoughts are one week of using the apple watch 9.The band: Because it is more of a mesh material, I was worried about the band staying wet. I get very sweaty during workouts and I like to rinse the watch off after. I found that it took about two hours of wearing it for the band to dry completely after getting wet. Not great, but also not too bad.The charger: The charger uses a USB c connection. This is a bit of a nuisance because it did not come with a wall adapter. The only place I can plug this in is into my laptop.The watch itself: The watch is sleek; I like the screen size and overall look. The watch controls are easy to use, the haptics/gestures are a nice touch.Watch faces: I was disappointed in the selection of watch faces. There are limited options compared to Fitbit/Garmin, and most are analog which is not my preference. I find digital time to be easier to read at a glance. Half of the watch faces were from Nike - I don\u2019t have any interest in being a walking Nike advertisement. Many of the watch faces are very customizable, which is nice, but the big failure here is that there is no option to see your step count on your watch face. I like to be able to see my daily steps at a glance, but it is not possible unless you download yet another app (more on this later).Health Tracking: The first thing I noticed is that the watch is not constantly reading your heart rate. On my Fitbit, I loved to be able to see my steps and my current heart rate at a glance. The apple watch is not constantly reading heart rate, so it says something like \u201c65 BPM - 8 minutes ago\u201d. It is not super useful to me to know what my heart rate was 8 minutes ago.Exercise Tracking: This is where I was really disappointed in the apple watch. One morning, I performed yoga for 15 minutes. I started a yoga activity before the workout, and it counted as 15 exercise minutes. Great. Later that same day I went to play tennis. 90+ minutes of high-intensity physical activity. I forgot to start the exercise on the watch - not too concerning to me because Fitbit recorded cardio exercise automatically. I was dismayed to find at the end of 90 minutes, my total exercise minutes was only 30. 15 from yoga, 15 from tennis. The watch also did not prompt me to start a workout during tennis, which it sometimes does while walking. It seems like with the apple watch, you have to be extra careful to start an exercise - otherwise the fitness tracking will not record correctly at all. Again, I really liked Fitbit, which automatically recorded exercise for me in an accurate way if I forgot to \u201cstart workout\u201d.Health Data: The first thing that annoyed me is that your fitness/health data is spread across multiple apps. You have the Health app, the Fitness app, and the Apple Watch app. I don\u2019t like having a ton of apps on my phone, and don\u2019t see any reason why health/fitness couldn\u2019t be wrapped up into the watch app. For me, the watch app should contain all of the data the watch is collecting. Fitbit/Garmin have a single app that make it easy to view data.Sleep tracking: The apple watch does a pretty good job tracking sleep and includes lots of data like heart rate/respiratory rate. My biggest complaint is that it does not tell me what time I fell asleep and what time I woke up like Fitbit did. I also really like that Fitbit gives you a sleep \u201cscore\u201d, and I don\u2019t see anything like that for apple.Battery Life: Obviously the battery life on the watch is not nearly as good as Fitbit/Garmin etc. This didn\u2019t really bother me though, I charged it for 15-20 minutes every day while I showered and this was enough to keep it going.After giving the apple watch a try, I decided to return it and go with something more fitness focused. I was disappointed because I had been really excited about the apple watch. It does have a lot of cool features and technologies, and I really liked the detailed health data that was collected. However, I felt that apple fails to present this data in an accessible way. I was also really disappointed by the exercise tracking. The watch is supposed to auto-detect exercise but after 90 minutes of tennis, it recorded only 15 exercise minutes and did not include an entry in the exercise history at all (within the fitness app). If you care mostly about smart watch technology and phone/watch integration, I think the Apple Watch 9 is a good option. But if you are focused on fitness, I would recommend going with another option.",

I needed to get a bigger face size as my tired eyes need all the help they can get while running without my reading glasses. The watch works as expected. I have an iPhone 12Pro and obviously have no issues with pairing or configuring the watch with the watch app. Battery is ok, but you definitely will not get days of battery life especially if you are exercising with the watch. There are other watches out there that may have better individual features and/or battery life, however, it is difficult for those other watches to beat the Apple watch in overall features and performance. It is for that reason that I give the Apple watch series 9 the five stars.",

It was worth every penny, and it was nice it was on sale too. It's been the most helpful for me with my workouts, and has increased my motivation seeing how many calories I've burned, keeping track of my heart rate, and more. The pink is lovely, and the sport loop is very comfy! Don't even feel it while sleeping. If you're debating it like I was, I don't think you'll regret it!",

It's a little larger on my small wrist, but I don't really notice. I appreciate the ECG option very much. The glass front seems very strong, as I've smacked it on things a few times, but not scratches or anything show up. It charges with the lightening cord very fast. Battery life has been good. I'm wearing it at night to track my sleep, and it's been great. Highly recommend.",

However reviewing my data is the one knock that I have. I would like to see the data on a bigger screen than my iPhone, but it is not available on my Mac, and my iPad is too old for the app to run. Still I am very happy with my purchase.",

I didn't like Fitbit because it needs a subscription while their battery life is good while Garmin is more of a Google/Android friendly and lacks what Apple offers. So I decided to get an Apple instead since I used Apple products. I have been using Apple for a couple months so far it's a good upgrade minus the battery problem where I have to charge it daily and they didn't provide a charging port (adapters) which only gives you the charger and not the adapter. So you have to buy an adapter separately or use a multi-charging station.",

This feature alone makes buying the watch a must. It also tracks your heart beat and will give you data by the minute each day if you so choose. In addition, if you have heart arrhythmias, you can show the ECG/EKG data to the doctor to prove you are having issues. Many times when you visit the doctor or the ER, you are not having the issues, or they go away, so they discharge you because they are not seeing it. Having the data on your watch makes all the difference as they can now see that you have issues. The exercise function truly does motivate you to exercise more often to meet your daily goals. It also sends encouraging messages once the goals are completed. The sleep function tells you how much time you spend in each phase of sleep. If you've decided to improve your lifestyle through healthy eating, drinking, and exercise, it is nice to see how your health data improves over time which is very motivating. There are so many other features with the Apple Watch that I haven't used yet, but for me, getting it just for the heart monitoring data is money well spent.",

I like the ability to have different watch faces that I can change by swiping the watch face. My everyday face is setup to tell me the time, date, outside temperature, Decibels (I like to see how noisy different restaurants are), pulse and heartbeat range, Messages, activity circles, timer (how long does it take to get that beer I ordered), and battery per cent. It is easy to navigate thru all these functions. My church face just shows time and another shows time and date in large letters that I can read without my glasses. Watch bands are easily changeable, so I put on different bands (ordered separately) for golf or more formal settings. As you can tell I am having fun with this watch.",

So this Wass one of my most used apps on my previous watch, and I was surprised when it wouldn't work on the series 9. The fall detection gives me a sense of safety when I am out walking or gardening and don't want to have my phone with me. I call it my Dick Tracey watch. It doesn't do that well at transferring a phone call, however it is good enough for emergencies, or to give you time to get your phone.

Best advice is to measure your wrist to buy the right size band. Also make sure to buy the wall plug for the charger since it is a different size. I bought a wireless charger for my iPhone and watch and that works as well if you don\u2019t get the plug. Picture is very clear and the app lets you set it up exactly as you want it. I bought a cover to go over my watch so it doesn\u2019t get scratched and I highly encourage that as well.",
