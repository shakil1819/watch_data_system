People ask me if it is an Apple Watch too and are surprised that it's not. You can manage the brightness on it. It can have your notifications on or off. It allows you to set alarms and connect to Alexa if you want to. It can handle washing dishes, working cattle/ horses, and every day wear and tear. It charges really easily and quickly. I have not had any problems with it so far and I have worn it every day for two months already. Super affordable too! You will need the download the app to go with the watch but the app takes up very little space and is super easy to use. You can also personalize your watch screen with your own photos!! (My favorite feature!)",

It works to track my steps, calories burned, and can track my sleep as well. I'm not sure how accurate everything is but it works just fine for me. It connects to my phone to show me notifications, what they are and who they're from. I can not text back or take calls on it. The band is comfortable enough, I don\u2019t really wear things on my wrist so I'm still getting used to it. It connects to Alexa, music pause/play/volume, find phone, camera remote, timer and stopwatch. You cant add any apps or background photos like on an apple watch. If you are looking for something simple, practical, and affordable, I would definitely recommend.",

My only gripes about it is that the fluid measurement is only in ml and that it does not have a calculator. I have the one that uses the app VeryFit, and I like the layout of it. Both watch and app are pretty customizable to taste or holiday season and it\u2019s pretty easy to navigate. I like the daily goals, they synced workout cycles and how you can set a water reminder. The timer is excellent. Since having it, my battery has only fallen below 60% once. I haven\u2019t figured out if you can swap the straps or not or if there\u2019s an apple case compatible with it, but bracelets and unprotected screens don\u2019t last very long with me and there hasn\u2019t been a single scratch on it yet.Overall I feel as though it\u2019s pretty accurate and easy to use! I\u2019ve recommend it to 2 people who\u2019ve been in the market for a similar type of watch",

                        "content": "Update: You can set your planned sleep time! But if I get up to go potty, it stops counting sleep data. Shows a couple hours of sleep and then it's purple for the rest of the night.Update: I figured out the exercise mode issue. Sort of. The reason it didn't register is because I was using a standing desk & walking pad. So my arms weren't moving. I tested it by starting the indoor run on the watch and just moving my arm back & forth with it in my hand. It only registered 9:24 minutes of a 15-minute test time but it did register on both the app and the watch. And it did add steps to my daily total. So, I upped the star rating to 3. Overall, it's ok for the money. We'll see if I get any sleep time tonight. PS-Customer service is pretty good. They will respond and try to help in a pretty timely manner.It is so hard to find one of these smart watches that actually works. Mostly, it's the apps. I think that's the case here. I've had issue after issue with this one. First, it wouldn't let me join Fitdock. Kept saying the server was having problems. So, I just continued thru setting it up. When I tried to change the face, I got a blank gallery. Turns out you need to join Fitdock and then you get a gallery of available faces. The watch insisted I do a factory reset on day 2. I tried everything but it would only work after a full factory reset. So, I lost everything from day 1. When I turned on Message notifications, I got a notification every few minutes on the watch telling me that my messages were available because I had paired a device. Annoying as all get out. Turns out that had something to do with my Google account but I'm not techy enough to explain it. Then more issues this morning. First, I did a 15-minute indoor run in exercise mode on the watch. It didn't register on the app, no real info about it at all on the app. Under Training, it says my workouts will appear there but there's nothing. I did find a reference of 3:24 minutes in the exercise record on the watch. But it didn't add anything to my steps for the day. Seems like if you have a goal of say 5000 steps and you use the exercise mode to record a run, those steps should be added to your total goal for the day. So now I'm not sure if it just didn't register the run, or if it will add to steps when you do a run. I think it did show an elevated heart rate because of the run, tho not entirely sure about that. No sleep record, either. It registered the first night but not last night. And finally, I tried to take my blood oxygen level and it just keeps telling me to confirm I'm wearing the watch. One good thing is you can use your own picture as a face. I have a picture of a cute drawing my granddaughter did when she was little. That's drawing me in (no pun intended). Cuz it's pretty cool to look at your watch and see your granddaughter's drawing. But the bad thing is you can only put time and date on your own picture. I want steps and a battery icon. Which brings up another gripe. A lot of the faces don't have the battery icon. But that brings up another good thing. The battery seems like it will last a good while. With all the messing around I've been doing with it over the last couple days and it's still at 95%. So, my decision is do I keep it as just a watch with my granddaughter's picture and take hit or miss on everything else. Or do I return it and try another one.",

I notice some of the measurements are wildly inconsistent but I really bought this for the step counting feature. At a few points it measured my heart rate at 209 but when I measured it myself, it was at 64. It also thought I slept 3 hours last night when I actually slept 8+ (I know because it was the best night of sleep I\u2019ve had in a while).It sounds like I\u2019m knocking it but I\u2019m quite happy and frankly, even with the inconsistent measurements, you can quickly figure out which ones are bogus and which ones are relatively accurate.If you want a smartwatch but don\u2019t want to pay and extraordinary amount, this is the one. It tracks steps well and beyond the inconsistencies, it allows me to get a pretty good reading on my heart rate, stress and sleep.One last thing, if you sweat or wear sunscreen, it\u2019ll likely not get proper readings.",

Easily connected to my Galaxy 24+, which has a light purple case and band was close to same color. The face isn't too big or too small. The band is soft and doesn't bother me at all when I'm sleeping. I have been easily annoyed by some previous watches. I like to keep track of exercise/steps and see how well I slept. I also like receiving notifications. Seeing heart rate and stress levels may be nice too. I had to turn off the feature that makes it light up when I move my wrist because it would wake me up. So far I've kept it off by may need to turn on during the day. Again, I've only had a couple days so there's a lot to figure out still. I'll try to remember to post an update in a few months.",

It tells you to sync your phone and I do it and it still doesn\u2019t work so that\u2019s the only flaw I have with it . Everything else is great especially for the value for your money. I love that you can customize your screen. Other than the weather it does great .",

                        "content": "Let me start saying that I hate to wear any wrist accessory, including bracelets and watches\u2026.or even rings. Possibly not being a good candidate for wearable monitors I expect more may be?I bought this smart watch only for one reason, I wanted to check my sleep pattern to see all the different phases of my night sleep. If you are looking for a review of a wellness device this is for you.I wore it asap I received it.I Downloaded the app and sync it. I wore in on left side (that is where I measure my BP with a traditional cuff). Although I expected not to be accurate as a blood pressure monitor\u2026..I assumed at least the sleep pattern function had some accuracy.I wore the watch for 18 hrs and tested steps and all functions related to wellness.Lest say that none of the functions listed for wellness will be ever accurate enough in any of these devices for the time being. Consider that an Oxymeter needs to read on finger not on top of the wrist and that a regular blood pressure wrist cuff lacks of accuracy as well. So, you cannot expect this type of accuracy from any wearable monitors. However based on movement and HR (heart rate) I thought it would give me some sleep pattern precision. It did not even registered the 2 times I woke up at night to pee. It just gave me a total of hrs sleep split in Light sleep and Deep sleep. Not enough details for me on the app graph. It also did not register my HR at night, or it failed to display it on the app screen on phone.Hearth Rate function overall sucked too. It gave me a reading of same HR for resting, minimum and maximum.The timer and steps functions are useless to me\u2026..I already use the sensor of my samsung phone. I cannot be bothered with the timer for the aerobics, I always used a traditional chronograph stop watch for training.Other functions such as music and messaging or phone calls I cannot write a review on those.In summary if you are using this as a wellness monitor, do not buy it because it will give you very inaccurate functions like O2, Blood Pressure, HR recording (through the night) and Sleep Pattern important details.",

They not only use two different apps but they also work totally different. The purple is more accurate in counting steps and more customizable with the picture and watch face. The red n black let's you change the Pic and color of the clock but not placement. It also doesn't count steps correctly, which was my main reason for getting it. So a bit disappointed with that. Plus, since they use different apps, I can't pair them together under the family profile. Pretty disappointed with it all. If I wasn't stupid and threw away the box, I'd probably return it.",

I figured out how to sink it for notifying me about calls, but cannot figure out how to get text notifications. If you are wanting a watch for fitness, this is definitely worth the money. Great bang for your buck. I haven\u2019t tried to use my headphones with it for music but am guessing it sinks to your phone instead of the actual watch. Even as a watch, you can\u2019t find one for this cheap, let alone with so many features. I figured out how to sink the weather too so overall very pleased with this product. Does anybody know how to sink your text messages? I turned on notifications within the app and on my settings.",

The app was easy to find and download and comes in both IOS and Android. The watch was easy to set up. I haven\u2019t started using it yet, as I\u2019m letting it charge fully. It does count steps, heart rate, has a sleep mode, and I have gotten text notifications on it already. Comes with a magnetic USB charger but no outlet block FYI. I will update after I\u2019ve started using and can provide better usage feedback.Editing to say: I\u2019ve used this watch 24/7 for the last 2\u2019ish weeks. I just had to charge the battery last night and it still has 21% left. It seems to track steps pretty accurately and the sleep mode looks pretty accurate. I leave it on to make sure all of my steps are counted from wake up to sleep. I like being able to get text messages from it too. I\u2019m not a huge fan of the straps. It either feels too tight or too loose, and the loops don\u2019t stay where placed to keep the strap from snagging (picture added to show which part I\u2019m talking about.) Sometimes when pushing the button to turn the screen on it\u2019s blank and black but you can tell the watch is on, not sure what\u2019s going on it just started that yesterday.",

I have been able to answer calls from my iPhone on it, view my text messages and messenger messages along with all of e-mails.The app that you need to download to track your activity allows you to even join groups like the Fitbit device to compete with other users of the device and join a little community for encouragement.There are so many features on this device that I know I will never use but that doesn\u2019t matter.

With features like heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen measurement, and sleep tracking, it provides valuable insights into overall health and well-being. I've found the heart rate monitor to be accurate and reliable, allowing me to track my heart rate during workouts and throughout the day. The blood oxygen measurement feature is also useful for monitoring oxygen saturation levels, especially during physical activity or sleep. The sleep tracking function provides detailed analysis of sleep patterns, helping me understand the quality of my sleep and identify areas for improvement.The watch itself is sleek and comfortable to wear, with a stylish design that complements any outfit. The battery life is impressive, lasting several days on a single charge.The TYKOIT Smart Watch offers excellent value for its price point, providing a wide range of features for fitness monitoring and overall health management. I've rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because the user interface could be more user friendly, it's still a solid choice for anyone looking to track their fitness and health metrics.",

It's been great at tracking my steps, you can set it to not interrupt you at sleep time. There are celebration features when I reach a milestone and I enjoy those popping up. Give it a try!",
