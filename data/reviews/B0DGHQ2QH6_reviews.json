I love the slimmer profile of the Series 10 compared to the previous models. The watch works seamlessly with my iPhone 15 Pro and my MacBook. There is a little bit of a learning curve and it will take some trial and error to get the face layout and complications the way I want it, but it's so easy to customize the watch. I may even use different faces for different moods or events. Overall, I highly recommend the Apple Watch Series 10",

Sure if you have the series 9 maybe you won\u2019t need the series 10 but if you\u2019re like me and you\u2019ve never owned one before or you have a very old model you\u2019ll be in for a treat",

It asks me to type in my password sometimes and I press buttons and it'll like auto delete them? This is buggy and really unprofessional to release something this bad.

                        "content": "Just received mine. I had a series 6, but decided it was time to upgrade. Because I had a previous watch set up on my iPhone SE (Gen 2), the transfer of all the settings took less than five minutes. My old band transferred easily. I wear my watch on my left wrist but I have it set up to wear as a left handed person (like I was going to wear it on my right wrist). That way the Digital Crown is on the lower-left of my wrist. The way it was before caused me to activate the Digital Crown accidentally. When the transfer was made to the new watch, it transferred that setting also. A couple of important things to note: first, it doesn\u2019t come with an advanced energy charger plug-in. Just the C cable, so if you are using a regular Apple plug-in, you\u2019re not going to see the speed charging. Secondly, a note said I needed iOS 18 on my phone to set the watch up automatically. So upgrade your phone before you attempt to transfer to your new watch. Otherwise, you\u2019ll need to set it up manually. Just the 2 mm difference in size between the old and new watches seems like it is a lot more. Great display, seems brighter. I look forward to playing with the apps, particularly the sleep apnea one, since I have been diagnosed with sleep apnea but can\u2019t sleep with a CPAP full face mask on. I also look forward to seeing what the new fitness app is like. If it hadn\u2019t been for a few new features, though, I probably wouldn\u2019t have upgraded. It\u2019s basically the same watch with a few added features.",

                        "content": "I made the switch from a Galaxy watch, and this is a major downgrade. The watch faces are pretty bad and I just want a step counter on the face that works. Not there unfortunately. I think they\u2019ve tried to make them so feature rich that they have neglected the basics. I had to install a third party app for a pedometer that doesn\u2019t update live on the watch face. I have to manually open the app on my phone to get it to update on the face. Yes yes, I know, super trivial, and also unnecessarily annoying.Oh and, we have to talk about the sport wrist bands that clasp from the inside. Why do people find this acceptable? It\u2019s like the AirPods that don\u2019t stay in your ears. It\u2019s ok to be critical of Apple designs that are awful.",
