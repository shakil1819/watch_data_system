                        "content": "When did it become so difficult to find an analog watch - you know what I am talking about- a traditional clock face type watch? How disturbing to me that some young people can\u2019t read a watch or clock like this -oh well- anyways, this watch from OLEVS keeps great time, looks good, and has a big face so it is easy to read for my 60 something husband who does not want to have to put on his reading glasses to see what time it is. He also showed me the watch band which of course is adjustable in size by easily removing band links which he does always need to do. He has had many watches over the years with similar bands, but this one has two latches that snap in place instead of just one so the watch band is extra secure and won\u2019t easily unlatch and fall off the wrist. Nice feature. The stainless steel is eye catching. Would definitely purchase again.",

                        "content": "This is a decent quality watch for the price. Been wearing daily for a few months now. It has maintained its color and been resistant to scratches. The sub dials are a fully functional timer/chronograph. Calendar is great addition. The band is good quality with tight fit. Mine came with a sizing tool which was awesome. Removed 3 links for a perfect fit. Not a big fan of the butterfly latch on the band as it can release when you bend your hand down, but for the look and price, I don't mind. Unfortunately, the other day, I took the family to Lake Tahoe where I slipped into the water at the shore. It was about a foot deep and soaked my clothes but no big deal. Shortly after I checked the time and saw water on the inside of the glass. I then noticed the reset button for the chronograph had fallen out. I thought it must have been from falling into the water though I couldn't understand how my wrist could have jarred the button out. When I got home, I found the button on the floor in front of the watch box that I keep it in. This means it just randomly fell out. It pushes back in but can be easily removed and the chronograph no longer works at all. The watch still runs but the water doesn't seem to want to dry out. Very disappointed as I really liked this watch. I wanted to contact Olevs about the 12 month quality warranty they claim on Amazon but couldn't find a way to contact them directly on Amazon. No contact info or links. The only options were product and seller feedback. Oh, and an address in China. Not much help. Glad to revise my review if the seller reaches out.",

So I have purchased 3 OLEVS watches at the same time (2 with Amazon, 1 with Walmart) Amazon order arrived several days late. But they look very nice and the price was very affordable. The problem with all 3 of my OLEVS watches is, the latch. They won't stay secured around my wrist and it takes away from the experience of owning what are otherwise very good looking time pieces that I get a lot of compliments on. It's unfortunate. But I'm done with the OLEVS brand",

The pins are legitimately impossible to take out of the links and if you try to put some force into it, you'll break either the pin or the tool (most likely the tool). If you use the tool from one side, the pin won't be able to come out of the other side. If you use the tool from the other side, the pin will come out but now your tool will be stuck and will be impossible to remove no matter how hard you pull. The watch itself is nice, but that doesn't matter if I can't even wear it.",

They got stuck in the band multiple times and had to be pulled out by force or would simply snap. The man in the video I watched was successful in taking the pins out, but he was using his own tool kit which looked much better in quality. The band itself also feels and sounds very cheap and like plastic. Do not buy unless you already have your own toolkit and preferably another band to replace the one already attached.
