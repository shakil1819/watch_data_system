                        "content": "I'm a woman and have very small wrists. I wanted a larger watch that I could easily read without squinting or putting on glasses as I don't like wearing glasses that much as I don't need them for my computer. But, I didn't want a huge watch. So, this watch was large without being huge. I knew that the band would not fit snugly, but this band was said by other reviewers to be a big small on them. I like bands to be loose so that they can sit down on my hand when I have long sleeves on or be pushed up a few inches on my arm when I'm doing something messy like cooking dinner. I also wanted an inexpensive but dependable and classic looking watch. Because it became fashionable for women to wear watches that looked like they'd borrowed them from the guy in their life, I felt this would be fine without seeming too odd.Also, I like to check the time when I wake up because I wake up so early and don't want to get up so early that I'll be exhausted later. So, the light was important to me. I've had a few Timex watches before, and I found the Indiglo feature very helpful.I was a little concerned about the stretch band pulling my arm hairs as I'd noticed on a watch a long time ago that that happened. This one very so slightly does that but mainly because it's loose and I move it around. If it were fit so it stayed put on my arm, I don't think it would do that throughout the day. It's not actually a problem as it's so slight. I don't really notice it much.As I said, I've had a few Timex watches in my life, and they tend to keep on ticking. My last one, honestly, didn't last more than 18 months, but that was an exception. Fortunately, I got that one very, very cheaply on a sale with points and so on at another retailer. I hope this one lasts for a few years as it has for others.While I like the dull metal stretch band, I am also considering getting silicone bands in different colors. They are pretty inexpensive, and you can get the quick release type that pop in and out easily to be worn with different outfits. I'm thinking of black, buff/pink (kind of like a white person's slightly tanned skin), and red. Maybe white too. For now, I'm just using the silver band. As another reviewer mentioned, the provided band is duller than the watch. However, it actually looks good that way. It's a more casual look than it would be with a shiny band. I also think it would look good with a shiny band, however.So, having read that some people had difficulty setting the day of the week, I handed this to my young adult son as he was just sitting around playing on his computer while to did all kinds of housework. He set everything but the day and didn't bother with the day of the week. Not intending to be his slave without any rewards, I looked up directions on the internet, sent them to him, and handed it back with just enough words to every so slightly shame him into doing it. I wasn't mean, but this kid got accepted to MIT. So, he did it. I also asked here for directions and got directions from the manufacturer and several other reviewers. So, look through the questions and the answers are there. Basically, you pull the knob out and turn it through as many 24-hour days as you need to to get to the day of the week you need. I think you go clockwise. The direction matters, so check that first. It's absolutely NOT a big deal once you know how to do it. I think the reason so many people have gotten confused is that these days were are used to clicking on things and having them set right away. It's the same reason many older people have trouble with digital things. They are used to mechanical things. Anyway, it's not a big deal and it's definitely not a reason not to buy the watch.As I said, I bought this watch because it had a big face and hands and would be easy to glance at without glasses AND because it had Indiglo lighting when you push the knob AND because it had both the day and the date. I do check my online calendar daily and schedule appointments every single day for my business and personal matters. However, I admit sometimes I forget what day it is and what the date is. One reason I didn't buy the women's version of this watch is that I wanted the DAY and the date, not just the date. The women's version must be too small to have both. What I've noticed is that in dim light, I have a harder time reading small print. Also, the day and date are much smaller than the numerals for the hours. That's normal, of course. But, I do have to work a little harder to read the day and date. Further, the day and date are not illuminated by the Indiglo light. I guess because this is a mechanical watch, they are turning on different disks and don't have that feature. However, when I check my watch in the dark, I only want to know what time it is and don't need to know the day of the week and date. So, it's not actually a problem. The only thing I would say about that is that because I can read it but it's harder to read and I rarely go without my phone, the day/date feature is probably not as important to me as I made it when I made the choice of the watch. I probably could have gotten the women's version and been happy with it.As for this man's watch on me, I had the idea that women's watches are frumpy looking and liked the idea of a bigger watch face, but I probably would like the utilitarian look of this watch in the women's size. I just got this so will think about this overnight. When I pinch about 5 of the links out, the watch actually looks pretty good and not like I borrowed a man's watch. So, removing some links is also an option. As I said, my wrist is tiny, and so many women would not need to remove any links to make this watch fit and some might have to add links. If I removed 8 links, it would be snug on me, but I wouldn't be able to dangle it down on my hand if I had long sleeves with snug cuffs or push it up on my arm if I were doing something messy. So, I do have options: loose if I do nothing, snug if I remove 8 links, and semi-fitted if I remove only 5 links.And, I can use quick release silicone bands to change the look to go with different outfits. I figured out that if I got the black band, that would work for business as it almost without looking closely would come off as a black leather band. It would also have a soft, comfortable feel (based on reviews and if you get the ones that are like that so read the reviews before buying). Although I don't mind the metal expansion band and didn't notice it when I wore this for an hour on an errand, I probably would love the soft silicone bands. I'm middle aged and healthy, but if you were older or had very delicate skin for other reasons, a soft silicone band would be a great option for you. You can get soft leather bands that would feel nice, but silicone is easier to clean, can be gotten wet without staining or swelling, and is sturdy. As it is, my skin is healthy, but I have sensitive skin, not thick or rough. I can't wear pierced earrings with nickle in them. I don't think that will be an issue for this watch as it never has been for a Timex before. but I did notice that one reviewer had removed the band but left the little bars in and looped a one-piece leather band through the bars so that there was almost no skin contact with the metal. If you want to look DIY or artsy, you can even make padded fabric watchbands that have snaps to hold the watch face or use thick grosgrain ribbon to make bands to your color preference. I would even sew velvet ribbon to grosgrain ribbon or sew lace to grosgrain ribbon to make a cute band for certain casual fun outfits or a slightly dressed up event where casual touches would look cute. Because this is so inexpensive and supplies for making watch bands would be cheap due to the size needed, you could give one of these to a teen and help them come up with lots of different bands for it. You can buy band hardware (buckles, etc.) easily online.The other thing to consider if you're very small boned is that larger watch will be heavier. My son, who is 6 feet tall and energetic, walking miles fast rather than driving, and fairly strong, also has small wrists and pointed out to me that a larger watch might feel heavy. He'd been given one years ago and took it off regularly as a result. He took it off in the orchestra room while playing his cello, and someone stole it. Having said that, this is smaller than many large-faced men's watches. It's not one of those huge watches. It covers about 2/3 of my wrist width, not all of it like many men's watches would. Although I noticed the weight when I put it on because my son advised me to consider that, it didn't bother me. With a silicone, fabric, or leather band, it would be even lighter. Heavier than most women's watches, but not as heavy as those chunky men's watches.When considering how practical it is to have a men's watch, I also considered size related to the small cuffed long sleeve shirts and long sleeved sweaters one might wear to work. How much of a hassle would it be to dig under my sleeve to get to the watch in a meeting? Truth is that I could wear this watch over a long sleeved thin sweater and get away with it because my clothes are so classic and practical. Also, because I live in Los Angeles where it's hot a lot and I am a woman who prefers short sleeves and jackets or cardigans to long sleeves as my main layer to avoid hot flashes, this is really not an issue for me. I also have the option of giving this watch to my son if I decide I want a smaller one and never wear it. However, I don't think he's taken the watch I gave him five years ago off since I gave it to him. So, that's all theoretical.In conclusion, I would say that this watch is a realistic purchase for a woman, even if she has small wrists. If she has very delicate skin as elderly people often do or wants it to be lighter, you can find some very nice, very inexpensive silicone watchbands that are easily cleaned and easily interchangeable with quick release pins. If she needs something breathable due to the heat, you could go with a thin leather band, a ribbon band (a thick ribbon or two layers of ribbon due to the weight and width) or a fabric band that you make or get on a crafter sales site. Or, she could wear it over a washable wrist band or a long sleeve. I personally think this is a great watch for teenage girls and boys if they would enjoy an analog watch because they can have fun with different bands.Edited to add: I slept with this watch on, but to be comfortable doing so, I put the watch over my sleeve on my long sleeved pajama top. I'm a person who doesn't like rough feeling surfaces on my skin, and so this made it comfortable to sleep in, and I didn't notice it during the night. The weight didn't bother me either. I have a feeling that silicone bands are in my near future unless I figure out a clever way to line the band with something soft. This is not a criticism of the band as it's a normal expansion band. But, I like smooth, soft surfaces next to my skin.Also, for those who have not had the Indiglo watch face light before, the more you use it, the faster your battery dies. It's not a big deal as the battery will last long enough, but just remember that and don't give it to a kid to play with for hours unless you want to replace the battery soon.And, I already have enjoyed the day/date feature as I woke up wondering if it was Thursday or Friday and glance at it first thing after I turned the light on at 4:30 a.m.Some might wonder why you'd buy a watch with an expansion band if you really want something softer next to your skin. For me, this 35mm watch face was a better size than the 40 mm Weekender Unisex watch Timex sells AND it has both the day and date whereas the Weekender Unisex has neither the day nor date. You can spend upwards of $40 for the Weekender Unisex with a grosgrain ribbon band or you can buy this and then go get whatever band you want. The silicone bands I like are very well reviewed and go for less than $12 apiece, so it's about the same price to get a quick release band plus the watch at a slightly smaller size that is better for me than to buy the Weekender Unisex model that is a little too big, doesn't have the day/date, and also might not have the color I want. I like the grosgrain bands a lot as they are comfortable and you can get them in lots of colors. But, you do have to wash them regularly. To wash them, I mix a little laundry detergent in very hot water in a small container, like a cup--just about half a cup of water is fine--enough to cover. Then, let it sit for several hours in that and then rub so that all the loosened soil and oil from your skin comes off, rinse in running water while rubbing and soak again in hot water to rinse. If you have to do that regularly, it helps to have another band or another watch unless you don't mind not wearing the watch for several hours. They might be more comfortable than silicone because they breathe, but the silicone can be washed and dried within minutes. For this watch to use a slip through band like the grosgain bands you can buy or make, you need the posts and I assume but don't know that you can just use the posts provided with this band. You can also buy them to make this watch accept slip through bands.",

                        "content": "It all started when I misplaced my trusty 21 jewels Japanese automatic. Don\u2019t ask me how it happened but it did. I\u2019m a dad of two, self-employed, always in some sort of situation or another, and no one has accused me of being organized. It\u2019s probably within twenty feet of me right now, but it could be on the other side of the world for all I know. At any rate, it wasn\u2019t on my wrist anymore and I felt naked. Sure, I\u2019ve got a phone, but I grew up with a watch, spent a lot of time learning to tell time when I was five or six, and I\u2019m damn sure not letting that all go to waste. I had to find a decent substitute watch until mine turned up. Something affordable, something solid, something utilitarian yet pleasing to the eye. Something that could take a lickin\u2019 and keep on tickin\u2019. That\u2019s it! A Timex. My first watch was a seven dollar Timex I bought with my own money when I was six. I can still remember my dad taking me to the local drugstore after school. It was a yellow brass case Easy Reader with a black rubber strap. A man\u2019s watch, huge on my scrawny boy wrist, but I loved it and had it for many years until at some point it disappeared\u2026.See a recurring theme here?So I began my search for a watch that wouldn\u2019t break the bank or, well, break. As I browsed, I came to this one \u2013 the Timex Easy Reader T20461. I immediately loved the look of it with its white face, Helvetica numbers, red 24-hour feature, silver-brass case, and stainless steel expander bracelet - which reminded me of the twist-o-flex watch bands my dad and grandfather always wore. The watch itself is akin to much more expensive \u201crailroad\u201d watches I had admired, but never considered buying. Without thinking twice I threw it into my cart, checked out and the man in brown brought it to my door within two days.Upon opening the box I wasn't disappointed. It looked better than the photos, felt solid and was easy to set. Yeah, the day and date require a little extra effort, but if this ruins your week you probably shouldn't get out of bed. It was the first time I wore an expander watch band and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it didn\u2019t pinch my arm hair at all. I\u2019m no gorilla, but I\u2019m not in kindergarten anymore either. One thing did bother me, though. While I appreciated the band, the way it tapers just looked a little lady-like on my wrist. Or maybe it was my wrist making the watchband look lady-like. Who knows? It didn\u2019t bother me too much and I loved the watch, so thought nothing more of it. That is, until I happened upon a watchstrap rack at a large big box store that shall remain unnamed. Hanging there was collection of the old school twist-o-flex expander bracelets I remembered so fondly from my dad and granddad. I found one that matched the shine of the watch case (the original band is a bit dull by comparison), paid a whopping 7 bucks for it (solid stainless steel), took it home, removed a few links to fit my lady-like wrist (it\u2019s not hard \u2013 you just need a decent pocket knife and a set of needle-nosed pliers or tweezers), slid it on my wrist and voila! The perfect watch for me. Easy on, easy off; tasteful styling; understated; doesn\u2019t scream \u201clook at me, I spend too much money on stuff because I feel inadequate!\u201d or \u201cMug me! I\u2019m obviously fiscally irresponsible so relieve me of my money!\u201dI hope I don\u2019t lose it, but if I do\u2026it\u2019s easy to replace. I wear it with pride and can\u2019t recommend it highly enough for men like me that need a practical, no-nonsense, solid, reliable, unpretentious timepiece. So far it\u2019s been dropped several times, drooled on, had coffee spilled on it and I forgot to take it off when I jumped in the shower the other day. Still as good as new. Oh yeah, Indiglo can\u2019t be beat. You might have a Rolex, but your Rolex doesn\u2019t have Idiglo.Sorry to say my other watch still hasn\u2019t turned up. If it does, I\u2019ll be happy to see it, give it a hug, then place it safely in my sock drawer until next time we meet.UPDATE: Still taking a lickin' and keeps on tickin'. Has a few character marks now, but runs as well as the day I bought it. Doesn't seem to gain or lose a second. I rarely take it off so it experiences whatever I do. I have, however, traded in the stretchy band for a leather nato that I snagged off another Timex (see pic).",

                        "content": "When my Seiko watch I had worn as an everyday watch gave up the ghost after 20 years, it was time to replace that faithful timepiece. I didn't want to spend a lot on a replacement and when I discovered that similar Seiko watches had gone up over five times the price my wife had paid for my now deceased watch, it was time to move my search for a new casual watch elsewhere. My wife suggested a casual Timex watch since I was going to wear it every day. Good suggestion.I chose this gold-tone Timex Men's 'Easy Reader' Quartz watch because I like the simple, uncluttered way it looks and also because its analogue quartz movement is easy to read. I'm getting up there in years and so simple and easy to read is important to me. I particularly like the larger black Arabic numerals, and because I am a veteran, the smaller red Arabic numeral 24-hour clock was a nice addition, too. Most of my previous watches have had a day-date calendar built into the face, so I appreciated Timex putting this feature in this new Timex watch. Another feature I didn't have on my Seiko was the nifty greenish Indiglo light that Timex included for checking the time in the dark. Just press the watch stem in and voila!, there is light. On some watches, the light will stay on until you press the stem again (or the battery dies). This Timex indiglo stays on only as long as the watch stem is pressed. I didn't see this as a problem since, in most cases, I would only be pressing the stem to find out what time it was or to read the calendar.The case on this Timex is slightly larger than the one on my Seiko. The diameter of the Timex case is about 1 3/8\u201d (35mm). My Seiko has a gold face, gold hands, gold numerals and a gold second-hand. You can probably imagine how difficult and accurately reading the clock must have been unless there was enough light. This Timex has a gold-tone case, wristband, stem and second-hand. Like the numerals, the clock hands are also black and the watch face is a contrasting white. Even with the gold second-hand, the white face makes it so much easier for my aged eyes to quickly read the time. The watch comes with an extra long and adjustable expansion band. Unless the wrist area of your arm is quite fleshy, links will need to be removed for proper fitting. I had that done for me at a local department store that sold Timex watches; didn't take more than 10 minutes. Of course, they knew what they were doing.The watch comes with what I thought was a small, rolled up user guide in the box. To my surprise, all it included was brief information (in eleven different languages) about the watch being water resistance, the battery and the international warranty; nothing regarding actually setting and using the watch. Okay. To get the manual, I had to download it from the Timex website using the model number to ensure I downloaded the correct manual PDF. The English version of the manual is 26 pages long; it covered everything I needed to know about this Timex watch. According to the manual, this Timex watch is both water and shock resistance (not water and shock proof!). The manual says it is \u201cwater resistant up to 30m (100 feet): in plain English, it withstands splashes or brief immersion in water, but not suitable for swimming or bathing.\u201dSetting the time and calendar was easy to do, though there was one surprise. To set the calendar day of the week (Sunday - Saturday), the clock hands had to be manually turned around and around (backwards!) until the desired day appeared in the calendar box on the watch face. That may seem easy enough unless the watch is showing Wednesday and you need it to read Saturday. That means you have to turn the hour-hand completely around the 12 on the face three or four times. That is really old school.Another task that needs to be tended to at the end of certain months of the year is correcting the numeric date on the watch calendar. Except for Feb, Apr, Jun, Sep and Nov, all of the other months have 31 days. So, when you get to the end of one of the months with less than 31 days, a manual adjustment must be made. For example, on 1 March my watch calendar read [WED 29] because February only has 28 days in 2017. For this reason I had to advance the numeric date ahead from 29 to 1 so the watch would read [MAR 1]. Just so you also know, the stem edge is very shiny and smooth, which makes turning the stem more difficult than if the stem head was notched around the edge for grip. Once I got the calendar set, I set the watch hands according to the U.S. Naval Observatory Master Clock (I did mention I was a veteran, right?). So far my new Timex watch has kept perfect time!Remember: Turn the hands \"forward\" (clockwise) to change the numerical date and turn the hands \"backwards\" to change the day of the week. If you try to do it any other way you will only frustrate yourself.UPDATE (24 March 2021): I've had this watch for four years now and it continues to keep time accurately to the minute. The Indeglo light still works fine and the watch still looks as good as new, even though I wear it often. And best of all, I have mastered adjusting the calendar!",

The included \"instructions\" were printed so small in so many languages, my older eyes would not read them. Had to look them up online. Can't tell you if there is any warranty - couldn't see it. Ended up figuring it all out and it works great. Just call me grumpy. He loves his new watch, the date and time are properly set, and the numbers are nice and large for his even older eyes to see. The band has enough give in it for his wrist to feel comfortable. The price was very reasonable. I recommend it.",

The band is stretchy and comfortable, though it does catch on my arm hair when putting it on or taking it off.Sizing the watch was also a bit of a pain without proper maintenance tools. I used a leatherworking awl and a pocket knife to pry the metal keepers open and remove/reseat the pins, and while this got the job done, through my own carelessness I scuffed up the edges of the band.Overall, this piece keeps time like a dream, as it the case with most Timex watches. Every now and again, I have to fiddle with the date, but that's to be expected. 4/5 stars!",

A few weeks go by, and I decide to take another look at it. Initially, I thought I would be receiving a metal clasp band, and this one was an expandable band; I'd looked at dozens of watches, so it was a common oversight for me. Anyway, I set the time, day, and date, and began wearing it. I am retired, and now work intermittently throughout the week where taking notes on time is necessary, and I need to be able to easily read the watch face; I am mid 50s. After wearing the watch the first day, I really do like it. I found myself actually sleeping with the watch on, not really noticing that I was wearing it. It is much different than my heavier watches, and it has become something of a comfort to wear, as it does not feel like a paperweight on my wrist. I also find it comfortable to wear with the watch face turned inside my wrist. With exception to bathing, I have pretty much worn this watch around the clock, day & night, only taking it off intermittently over the past few weeks of wearing.Of note: a couple of things I have noticed. First, it takes the watch a few hours to change the day of the week, with the day changing somewhere around 3am. I was going to take note of when it actually changed, but fell asleep. I will try to include a few pics I took. The other thing of note, was that one afternoon, between 1500-1530 hours, the hour hand somehow moved to the 1600 hour mark. I am not sure what caused this, and can only guess it was some kind of internal gear slippage, but it has only happened that one time; about 4 or 5 days ago, and has not done it again since. These are minor to me, as I understand that certain quality can be expected with a $40 (slightly less actually) watch. Overall, I am pleased with the watch, and find it as my preference to wear at the moment. My wife says it looks like an 'old man's' watch, to which I think, well, I am getting there,...LOL",

I have used these watches for the last 15 years, have bought a few. At times difficult to find a place in today's world who would replace a battery.

                        "content": "I had been looking at the Timex \"Weekender\" series of watches for a couple of months, debating whether to buy one at the $37 most department stores in my area seem to be wanting for them. I had a couple of reservations about the Weekender, however:(1) The fabric band seemed thin. While good for comfort, it seemed like it might not last too long before needing replacement due to fraying or tearing. Reading reviews on Amazon later seemed to confirm this.(2) I frequently wash my hands or have to work outdoors. In either instance, moisture from either incidental splashing or sweat would soak into the fabric band, making it prone to stink. I've had this problem with previous fabric- and leather-banded watches I've owned.(3) The buckle, while not bulky, was likely to cause some chafing and discomfort, the same as most previous watches I've owned. I spend a good portion of my time working at a computer, and when I type or I'm otherwise sitting at my desk working on something, I tend to rest my wrists on the desktop. This has caused previous buckles to dig into my wrist and resulted in soreness and mild itching.The Timex T20461 Easy Reader Silver-Tone Stainless Steel Expansion Band Watch has most of the features I liked about the Weekender series. It has a reasonable-sized face that doesn't look dainty on my average-sized wrist (I'm 6'3\" tall and currently weigh in at about 200 lbs.) Its face is very close in size to the Weekender's, but the T20461's high-contrast black font on white background is something I actually think is an improvement over the Weekender's black font on an off-white or eggshell color background.This is the first time I've ever given an expansion band a chance. I always thought they would pinch and pull at my arm hair, and I always worried about buying one only to find it slightly too large to stay securely on my wrist, but I'm pleasantly surprised that neither is an issue with the Easy Reader. And as a bonus, the stainless steel expansion band seems to be holding up better than the leather, fabric, and clasp-style metal bands my watches have had in the past. There is some scuffing on the bottom of the band where it has rubbed on the desk when I work, but it's only noticeable if you look very closely.The Indiglo light is nicely integrated into the crown so the watch retains a clean aesthetic. Its day and date are pretty easy to set using the supplied instructions, though for some reason I had to turn the crown the opposite way indicated in those instructions to get the date to advance.I've now been wearing the watch every day for two weeks, and I like it more each day. I'll update this review should anything go wrong with the watch such as water intrusion causing it to become inoperable-- it's supposed to be water resistant to 30 meters, but I've had incidental splashing from washing my hands seep in through the crown and ruin the internals on other (non-Timex, admittedly) watches in the past. Of course, the good thing about the expansion band is I can simply slide it up my wrist a bit to keep it further from the water while washing my hands, so this hopefully will be no issue.",
