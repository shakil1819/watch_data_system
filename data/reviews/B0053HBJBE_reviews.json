The little light you can use to illuminate the time is helpful as well! I also like the size of this lil watch! Not too small, not too bulky, and easy to see! I recommend this watch!",

I bought it for those reasons but also because the listing on Amazon shows a countdown timer. I do not see that function in the manual or on the Casio site. I am disappointed because that is how I narrowed my Casio choice down to this one. I would\u2019ve purchased a different one(say the world timer or ae 1300) had I known this didn\u2019t have the timer. I am a runner and not sold on a smart watch so I was hoping to use the timer on runs. For now I\u2019ll use as everyday casual wear and still enjoy glancing at the time on a run vs. digging for my phone. Also female with small wrists and aside from the band being a tad long I feel the 42 mil is a great fit.",

Since I just received it, I can't write on the quality but I have 3 other Casio watches, one for 9 years, and have no complaints. So, I expect the same quality in this one. I purchased this one because all it shows is the day, date of the month, and the time. I do not like a \"busy\" watch face with dials, circles, and other junk. For me, this one is perfect.",

After wearing the f91w, I noticed some quirks (the small size and very poor light) so I found myself doing some research which led me to this beauty. First, it\u2019s a much bigger profile which is nice because it didn\u2019t feel like a kid\u2019s watch but not heavy. The band is bigger and it feels like it would not fall off my wrist (and I don\u2019t even have big wrists). Second, the display is much bigger for the date time etc. (old eyes). And finally third, the light is much brighter allowing the entire screen to illuminate very well and bright. All in all, both are great watches but for a classic look and performance, I\u2019d go with the successor.",

Like the stop watchfunction but haven't used it. Probably should be a separate functioning \"watch\" altogether.Also, do not use the alarm function. Regardless, is a good value for its watch functions.Suggest a cloth or velcro strap over the plastic strap that comes with the watch. Plastic doesnot absorb any moisture (sweat ), whereas an absorbent strap does and is easily washable.",
