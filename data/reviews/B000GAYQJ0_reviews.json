                        "content": "Ha. This is a watch of contradictions. Cheap, yet well-made. Small, but noticeable. Old, but it feels so damn new. The watch performs flawlessly and despite mentions of it being retro, it is slick, modern, and even better looking in person.I will say, however, that I found the included contract unusual and potentially disturbing. When I placed the order, a prompt I\u2019d never seen before appeared, inviting me to read and sign a contract. The document stated rather explicitly that the watch was for \u201chandsome guys\u201d and that I would not be permitted to wear it if I was a \u201cmajor uggo\u201d. Whatever. I signed the contract and placed the order. What happened next was the truly unexpected...Two days after placing the order, I received a knock on my door very late at night. I wish I could tell you what time it was, but I did not yet own the watch so it is impossible to say. I peered through my peephole and saw the figure of a tall man in a long coat. Slowly, I opened the door and asked him what he wanted. It\u2019s then I noticed a wristwatch with the largest band I\u2019d ever seen wrapped around his forehead. It was analog, so I couldn\u2019t tell the time. The man introduced himself in a voice so quiet his words were almost drowned out by the ticking of his pretentious headwatch. \u201cI\u2019m with Casio,\u201d he says. Or maybe \u201cDime sith mass E oh\u201d. Hard to say. Still confused, I asked him again what he wanted. It was then that things took a turn for the worse.Uninvited, he stepped into my home and grabbed my face with his cold, dry, watch-tuning fingers. I tried to resist and found my body unresponsive. I\u2019ve later theorized that his stupid, unreadable headwatch was in some way hypnotic and temporarily robbed me of my senses. By the dim porch light, he jerked my head around, carefully but methodically inspecting every angle of my face. It obviously wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d conducted this sick facial analysis.Suddenly, he stopped. With me still immobile and deathly frightened, he took a step back, gave me one final, fleeting check and muttered \u201cAcceptable. Seven out of ten.\u201d Having said this, he promptly tapped the dial on his gaudy headwatch and I fell to the ground, exhausted and overwhelmed by my experience, but released from his spell.The next thing I knew, it was morning and someone was calling for me. \u201cSir? Sir? Are you okay?\u201d I looked up and saw my door was agape and the mail person stood above me, package in hand. Embarrassed to have been defeated by the mysterious man and his unfashionable watch, I simply nodded and began to stand. Obviously unsettled, the mail person handed me the package as I rose and told me to have a good day. It was my watch! And boy, what a watch it is!The moral of the story is this: the watch is incredible, and at $20 perhaps the finest entry-level watch money can buy.However, potential buyer, I caution you this: if you are any less than a 6.5 or 7 out of 10, don\u2019t kid yourself. Perhaps you\u2019ve got more a F91W or G-Shock type of face, and that\u2019s nothing to feel bad about. Not everyone can be handsome! Just be careful - I\u2019ve heard the watchman and his hideous headwatch do not look kindly upon the unattractive.",

I have an apple watch but sometimes want to wear just a simple watch. The silver is a perfect color and hasn\u2019t tarnished or anything for the time i\u2019ve had it. The instructions were easy to use for setup but there was no instructions on how to adjust the size of the watch which was odd because it isn\u2019t that obvious to figure out. After a short google search I was able to resize it fairly easy. I like that it shows the date information as well as it having a light for low light situations. I love the watch and can see it becoming my daily watch as it is very stylish too.",

                        "content": "Sometimes it's really hard to beat the classics in terms of style. I bought this just to wear with some outfits and change up from my other watches.Pros: Easy to setup, easy to read in general lighting, easy to adjust band size on the fly without any tools. In my opinion, I don't think this specific style will ever not go with just a simple \"day out\" outfit. If you're a little exhausted of smart watches like I am, this can offer some reprieve- the features this has is standard digital watch features, but work really well.Cons: The light on this model has always been mediocre- If you are using your watch in a dark environment consistently, be mindful of that. It seems to only shine from the left side of the face, and can be hard to read. If you're a guy with arm hair, the default band seems to grab and pull a little more than other bands. Speaking of the band, if you have broader wrist/arms, this band and face may look a little out of place with how small they are.Overall, it's hard to beat the price point for the style of watch you're getting. They seem to last quite awhile as well. A great budget beginner watch to jump start a collection with.",

You can dress it up or down and it still looks like it belongs with almost any outfit.Only minor complaint is the light. The back light source comes from the top corner of the watchface so it doesn't illuminate the whole screen, making it a little hard to read even in complete darkness.Again, great for the price so between the value and the style I think its totally worth a buy.",

Owning this watch has not made any major change in my life, there is only so much a watch can do for you. But I enjoy wearing this watch, It's something small which I can enjoy without any expectations.I have enjoyment from watching television and drawing pictures, learning languages. But all of these things come along with expectations. I expect to be entertained by a show, or to have a productive session of drawing or studying. sometimes my expectations are not met, and I end up feeling bad. Wearing this watch comes along with no expectations, and I still enjoy it. building expectations for how things should go seems to have a unique ability for sucking the joy out of otherwise pleasant or good things. so a simple thing like this which will only ever do what i expect it to do, and brings me some small happiness by it's pretty look, is a valuable thing worth much more than what i paid for it.",

Through washer AND dryer it still works as good as new, there\u2019s a stop watch, an alarm, and the month and date on the watch there\u2019s also a functioning light in the watch for when it\u2019s dark and can\u2019t see, you can\u2019t see anything in the picture (the camera didn\u2019t pick it up) but trust that it\u2019s very visible in person, also a side note; the watch beeps every hour.

For the price, you can't ask for better. One note: the backlight is basically useless. It's like there's a tiny, tiny light bulb in the upper left corner that tries to cast light across the face, but the light barely makes it half way across. if you want to know more than what hour it is, you're out of luck--minutes in the dark are slightly better than a guess, and seconds are just not visible. But the thing is: that is 100% period-accurate for digital watches in the 80's. I had a watch with a back light just as bad when a kid. It's worthless as a backlight, but the memory of its uselessness still makes me smile. So, maybe not great if you're trying to conduct spy missions in the night. But as a fun watch that you don't have to worry about scuffing up--with tons of GenX-flashback potential--it's perfect.",
